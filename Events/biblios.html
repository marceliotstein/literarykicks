<H1>An Evening at Biblio's</H1>

On Valentine's Day, Meg Wise-Lawrence<BR>
and I hosted a fiction/poetry<BR>
reading of Web writers at Biblio's<BR>
cafe/bookstore in downtown Manhattan.<P>

The agenda was pretty loose -- we'd<BR> 
selected an eclectic group of thirteen<BR> 
readers from various places on the<BR> 
internet, and we'd given no instructions<BR> 
except to keep it to under ten minutes.<BR>  
It turned out to be a great night!  First ...<P>

kicked off the evening with a<BR> 
short spoken-word performance.  I then pulled<BR> 
out my guitar and joined her for an homage to<BR> 
Patti Smith which had been inspired by a passage<BR> 
Meg had read one night in a physics textbook.<P>
