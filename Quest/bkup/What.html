<blockquote><B>
LitKicks is looking for some great unknown writers.  We're also looking to heighten the experience of writing as a <I>public</I> process: sharing, listening, reacting and learning.<BR><BR>

THE QUEST will debut on October 1, 2003.<BR><BR>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbspIt's LitKicks taken to a new level. It's a four-week passage through a series of literary challenges, conducted in small, intensive groups, and designed to provoke reactions, uncover hidden truths and lead you to a new understanding of your own identity as a writer.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbspIt's something like a writing workshop. You will create and submit new works -- poems, stories, memoirs, opinion pieces -- to be critiqued by others in a supportive and sympathetic environment. You will also help other writers by responding to their work.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbspIt's something like a contest, a search for new talent. At the end of each writing challenge, the groups will select the most remarkable works for sharing with other groups. At the end of the four-week process, several works will be chosen for publication on LitKicks.com and in an upcoming LitKicks book.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbspIt's something like a poetry slam. The weekly challenges are designed to ensure freshness and spontaneity. We do not want writers to rely on familiar formulas or hand in stale, tired work. Our process is designed to move fast, burst through boundaries and take both readers and writers by surprise.<br><br> 

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbspAnd it's something like a guided tour through an unknown land ... your own personality. The process is designed to inspire new ways of thinking, help you discover styles and formats you have never tried, and lead you to understand how others view your writing skills and talents.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;THE QUEST will begin on LitKicks.com on October 1, 2003. The entry fee is $20. THE QUEST is designed to appeal to both serious, experienced writers and interested beginners. No writing or publishing credentials are required.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Please join the friendly folks who bring you LitKicks.com for this unique literary exploration. If you have never visited LitKicks, there is no better way to delve deeply into this community and this creative process. And if you already know and love LitKicks, you won't want to miss this groundbreaking experiment.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;THE QUEST is LitKicks Extreme ... LitKicks on a Mission ... LitKicks Code Red. Whatever you call it ... it will be an experience to remember.
