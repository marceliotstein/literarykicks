          <H2><img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Waking Up</I></H2>   

The key word for the first QUEST assignment is <B>morning</B>.  You are to write a short piece that will evoke the sense of morning -- sunrise, awakening, facing a new day, arising from a dream state -- in your readers.<P>

Assuming that you're awake right now, you know what waking up feels like. Arising from the murky depths of night to the realities of conscious life can be a frightening, bizarre, funny, or beautiful experience.  Invent a fictional morning, or recall an actual one, and surround your readers with the details that will make your mental pictures vivid. Be as funny or serious, true or fictional as you'd like, but be honest.<P>

You may write in any format or style, but please make sure the concept of morning is essential in your piece.  We'd also like you to focus on lyricism and description.  Whether you're writing poetry or prose, the ability to create vivid images and smooth phrases is a good thing to have in your arsenal.  Think about what it feels like to wake up, and try to capture that feeling.<P>

          <H2><img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestions</H2>   

If you already have an idea for your "morning" piece: great, you're all set.  If you don't know where to go with this, here are some suggestions to get you started:<P>
          <ul>
          <li><B>Poem:</B><br> 
          Write free or metered verse, your choice. We like haiku, but it's not what we're looking for with this. Your poems should be short but not too short; write at least 10 lines. If you choose to write in a very structured form (like a sonnet), be meticulous with your meter, but don't force your words to fit a pattern. They will flow if you let them.<br><br>

          <li><B>Childhood Memory:</B><br> 

          Recall a significant morning scene from your own life.  This can be a general scene or a recollection of a specific event.  Tell us the story exactly as it took place.<br><br>

          <li><B>Physical Description:</B><br> 

          Whether you emerge gently with the sun shining on your cheeks or are blasted out of your bed by a blaring alarm clock, waking up is always a highly physical experience -- you FEEL your morning with your entire body.  Let a detailed physical description form the backbone of your piece.  Think about what you see and hear.  Think about your breathing and your heartbeat.  Then, think about your character's physical experience of awakening as a metaphor for their emotional state -- how this character is facing (or not facing) the problems in his or her life.  But you don't have to write explicity about the emotions or the problems -- you can subtly suggest thedeeper issues, while simply recording physical details with us much realism as you can.  Let the emotional meaning arise invisibly from the physical details.<br><br>

          <li><B>Dreams:</B><br> 

          Write about the contrast between your character's dream and your character's actual life.<br><br>

          <li><B>Waking up with somebody else:</B><br>

          Who else is in bed with your character?  This assignment offers possibility for human comedy or drama.  But, don't get so lost in the relationships between characters that you forget to focus on the concept of morning.  Your characters can react together to the process of awakening and facing a new day. 

          </ul>

          <H2><img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples</H2>   
         
          Finally, we'll leave you with this snippet of Kate Chopin's novel <i>The Awakening</i>. Chopin used physical sleep/waking descriptions to build up to her character's mental/spiritual awakening at the end of the book. This is not here for emulation purposes, but just as an example.<br><br>

          from Chapter 13:<br><br>

          She slept lightly at first, half awake and drowsily attentive to the things about her. She could hear Madame Antoine's heavy, scraping tread as she walked back and forth on the sanded floor. Some chickens were clucking outside the windows, scratching for bits of gravel in the grass. Later she half heard the voices of Robert and Tonie talking under the shed. She did not stir. Even her eyelids rested numb and heavily over her sleepy eyes. The voices went on--Tonie's slow, Acadian Drawl, Robert's quick, soft, smooth French. She understood French imperfectly unless directly addressed, and the voices were only part of the other drowsy, muffled sounds lulling her senses.<br><br>

          When Edna awoke it was with the conviction that she had slept long and soundly.
