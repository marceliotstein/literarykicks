                                 The Statue And The Bird<BR><BR> <BR>     The summer was fading and the pretty flowers of the park began to lose their brilliance. But the poor homeless people hardly noticed as they sat on the wooden benches encircling the statue.<BR>     Statue: "Pretty bird, you sing your tune so well. You have entertained me all the summer through. I need you to do me a favor, though    <BR> Bird: "You are such a powerful and vibrant statue; a solder of so many days gone by. What favor could you possibly want from a little sparrow?"    <BR> Statue. "I was a proud and brave warrior from days gone by, but around me sit old soldiers who are poor and hungry. They need our help; especially the old man in the torn red jacket on the bench at my feet." <BR> Bird: "Yes, I see the one. He looks so forlorn. What could a little bird do for such a man?"<BR> Statue: "Take my sword and unleash it from my belt tonight. Then drop it at his feet. He will know what he can buy for it."     The bird did as the statue asked. The next morning the old man bought himself a warm jacket for the oncoming winter. The bird sat at the statue's feet singing his pretty song as he began to feel the weather change.<BR> Statue: "Little bird I am so proud of you, but I have one other favor to ask. Could you take my silver helmet from my head and give it to the poor man sitting on the bench to my left."<BR> Bird: "But, brave statue, your head will get cold as the winter comes on. You will need your helmet so you will be warm."<BR> Statue: "Little bird, the old man needs food more than I need my helmet"<BR>  "I will do as you request" said the little bird. (at this <BR>point 'play diologue' becomes 'prose' for the astute reader to recognize)<BR> The next morning the statue's head was bare, but another old man had food for the approaching winter.<BR> A few days later the statue called out to the bird: "Little sparrow, yet another old man sits opposite me and needs new trousers to replace his thin, torn pants. Could you take one golden eye and drop it at his feet so that he can buy new trousers for the cold?<BR> Bird said, "I can do this favor that you ask but the days grow short, the weather grows cold and I must soon fly South or I will not survive. The next morn the bird delivered his precious gift of the golden eye. The statue smiled as the bird sang, but, thought the statue, not as vibrantly as his little friend once did.<BR> The statue saw, through his remaining eye, another soul with frayed and tattered shoes. "Little bird" said he, "One more favor I must ask. Please take my remaining eye and give it to the man whose shoes are so very torn."<BR>    "But," said the bird, "the weather has grown so cold, I cannot make it to the South unless I leave this very day."<BR> But the statue said to the little bird, "I need this one last favor for you to do, so that poor man can make it, the winter, through.<BR> The bird took the statue-warrior's remaining eye and delivered it as he was requested to do. <BR> The very next day, the bird said to the statue, "Dear brave friend, I can no longer leave you alone, because you cannot see any who may need your helping hand.”   <BR>    On the following morning, the cold white snow began to fall. The bird rested still and motiomless on the statue's head and each had a smile frozen on its face, as winter arrived at this frigid place.... <BR>     Three months went by and the village staff soon came to usher in the flowers of spring. One workman looked at the little park and said, “How run-down our city has gotten”.<BR>     The other one said quite casually,  "We must have that statue repaired very soon. I never noticed how shabby it had become.”<BR> <BR>

                  An excellent story! There are a few dodgy phrases but that's expected in a first draft. My only beef is that it wasn't all in dialogue -- The same story could, I think, be told in dialogue. For example instead of saying "the bird went and did it." you can say "Statue: 'thank you bird for doing it.'"<BR>  You get the gist anyway.<BR> As far as the idea and subject matter goes, it is a brilliant little fable, and relevant too.

                  i think this is a wonderful story.<BR><BR>a fable about giving and helping... about seeing and giving away that sight just because one sees.<BR>a story about the traces of existence that cause a shabby look for some and a monument of empathy for others....<BR><BR>considering the given topic of week two, i do agree with elvin about it being to much in prose and not enough in dialogue, though. but i think this could be changed with a few slight shifts.<BR><BR> apart from that, i like it a lot.<BR>i can see that place in the park in my mind....

                  eugene,<BR><BR>great fable. this should be turned into an illustrated book <BR>(good for kids and adults, too).<BR><BR>i say don't worry about the dialogue vs. prose issue. the format should, as always, be determined by whatever works best for the piece under construction. the mix of prose seems to fit this piece alright. <BR><BR>this raises the broader question as to whether "dialogue" is simply a matter of form or something more -- there can be a spirit of dialogue within a work which is not formatted like a dialogue in a play.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

                  Gene,  this reminds me of a parable or an old fable like the other said.  i enjoyed it but it was missing aspects of the whole "dialogue" thing.  <BR><BR>however, i loved the fact that the little bird stayed with his friend the statue through the winter to be his eyes.  and i love that the city will repair him as opposed to replace him.  i was afraid i was going to read the word "replace" there and I was going to be sad for the bird that his friend was being taken away.  <BR><BR>heh.  <BR><BR>isn't it funny what you can think/feel about characters in such a small little story in a short amount of time?  have you ever read a book and when you've finished wonder what the characters are doing now?  or think about them in other situations and how they would react based on what you know about them?  <BR><BR>anyway, good story eugene.  have you ever seen a statue with gold eyes?<BR><BR>~picasso<BR>
