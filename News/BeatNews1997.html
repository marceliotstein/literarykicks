Beat News </H1>

<I>(Yes, this is a photo of Burroughs and Kerouac, apparently
posing as private detectives)</I><P>

<H3>December 30, 1997</H3>

I'm really sorry about the way Beat News is turning into an
obituary page lately, but I have to report that poet Denise Levertov
has died.  Born in England in 1923, she was introduced by San
Francisco's literary ringleader 
<A HREF="../People/KennethRexroth.html">Kenneth Rexroth</A>
to the Beat crowd that emerged there in the late 50's.  She
also became an integral part of the Black Mountain poetry crowd,
along with Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, etc.<P>    

The book 
'<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/beatwomen.htm">Women of the Beat Generation</A>'
has some good material
on her, especially an account of her confrontation with sexism
in San Francisco's poetry crowd in 1957.  Anyway ... when it rains
it pours, but I'd like to mandate that no more legendary Beat or otherwise
worthy counter-cultural figures shall die in the next couple of years.  I 
plan to spend 1998 writing about lots of great new
creative literary activities, and *not* looking back.  Happy New
Year everybody!<P>

<H3>December 3, 1997</H3>

Kathy Acker, a courageous neo-Beat experimental writer who
emerged as an exciting literary talent in punk-rock-era 
late 70's New York City and has been writing good deconstructive
transgressive stuff since then, has died of cancer at the age
of 53.  Here's 
<A HREF="http://acker.thehub.com.au/acker.html">a site devoted to her</A>.

<H3>November 21, 1997</H3>

1. Proving once again that I am the single slowest web designer 
who ever lived, I have just now finally finished my memorial
tribute to William S. Burroughs.  It's called
<I><A HREF="../SlicedBardo/index.html">Sliced Bardo</A></I>,
and it includes spliced-in material from Lee Ranaldo, Robert
Creeley and Carolyn Cassady, as well as a touching description of
a Buddhist-inspired after-death ceremony held in Burroughs' honor,
written by Patricia Elliott.<P>

2. "The Beat Generation In New York" is a really enjoyable
and well-researched historical sweep through New York City
in search of Beat relics and places.  The book is by Bill Morgan, who
worked very closely with Allen Ginsberg in recent years, and
as Morgan was preparing this book I had the pleasure of following
him on one of the walking tours documented in this book.  
He speaks with authority, and this book captures it well.
It was published by 
<A HREF="http://www.citylights.com/">City Lights</A>,
and you can find it on their list of 
<A HREF="http://www.citylights.com/CLpubRE.html">recent releases</A>.
Janine Pommy Vega's captivating new book "Tracking The Serpent,"
a beat-informed geographical memoir chronicling her journeys to faraway
places, can also be found on this page.<P>

3. Al Aronowitz is
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/">in the house</A>.
Calling himself "The Blacklisted Journalist", this feisty
counterculture-oriented former New York Post reporter has fallen 
out of favor with one establishment after another, 
and is now bypassing them all and trying to reach the world
directly through his ever-growing website.  His beat legacy is awesome --
apparently he is the person who introduced Allen Ginsberg,
Bob Dylan and the Beatles to each other.  His observations on
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column21.html">Ginsberg</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column22.html">Kerouac</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column23.html">Cassady</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column24.html">Joyce Johnson</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/column25.html">etc.</A>
are raw and densely woven with personal rivalries ("I was on Allen's
shit list when he died ...") but they're good reading, and
that's what counts.<P>

4. A star-studded crowd of Kerouac readers, including Willem Defoe,
Ed Sanders, Anne Waldman, Maggie Estep, Lee Ranaldo, Doug Brinkley, Todd
Colby, Ann Douglas, David Amram and many others, will be pondering
the recently released "Some of the Dharma" (see below) at 
St. Mark's Church 
<A HREF="http://www.poetryproject.com/">Poetry Project</A>
on Dec 3rd.  Should be good.  But please don't forsake your
friendly neighborhood internet hacks for these admittedly more impressive 
lineups -- the night before, on Dec 2nd, I'll be participating in a
<A HREF="http://www.xmel.com/webwriters.html">reading of web writers</A>
to celebrate my own recently published anthology
<I><A HREF="http://www.coffeehousebook.com/">Coffeehouse: Writings From The Web</A></I>.  
It's at the Manhattan Internet Lounge at 678 Broadway near 4th Street,
and if you can make it I promise you a unique evening.  Hope to see
some of you at both events!<P>

<H3>September 29, 1997</H3>

1. I think I've been to too many Beat events in large lecture halls
and sterile auditoriums lately.  Take, for instance, the case of
jazz musician David Amram, who back in the old days used to jam with 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
at poetry readings.  I'd seen Amram perform at 
various tributes and memorials, but he never clicked with me; I didn't 
like it that he dressed like an orthodontist (albeit with a variety
of unusual-looking musical instruments around his neck), and
I never liked his hammy, pull-out-the-stops
performance of the title song (which he wrote) for the film 
'<A HREF="../Films/PullMyDaisy.html">Pull My Daisy</A>.'<P>

But then I caught his act at the Nuyorican 
Poetry Cafe, sharing a bill with Ron Whitehead, Brian Hassett and others, 
on a night that happened to be the night 
William S. Burroughs
died (though nobody knew this at the time).  He didn't sing 
"Pull My Daisy" and I ended up loving every minute of his
performance.  I think the problem has been the bright lights,
the uncomfortable chairs and the academic atmosphere of 
some of these earlier events.  In a small dark smoky club way
past midnight a vintage hip-cat like David Amram can finally show us
who he is, and this night at the Nuyorican I understood for the first
time why Jack Kerouac wanted him onstage while he read his poems.
Amram's passionate belief in the power of music is infectious.
At one point he had the entire crowd going in 
a two-part syncopated handclap -- one half of the room providing
one beat, the other half complementing it -- that was, I 
realized, probably the most complicated musical arrangement
I will personally ever participate in.<P>

David Amram also has his own 
<A HREF="http://www.fmp.com/amram/">web page</A>,
now, so I figure it's about time I write about him in Literary Kicks.<P>

2. This must be my month for coming to terms with people
I didn't appreciate before.  A few weeks ago a young editor
at William Morrow named Benjamin G. Schafer challenged me
to read a book he'd just put together: the Herbert 
Huncke Reader, published by Morrow this month.  I've 
always found Huncke an intriguing
personality -- a more street-wise original-junkie 
friend of the core New York beat writers in the 1940's, 
he shows up as a colorful character in 
'<A HREF="../Books/Junky.html">Junky</A>',
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>,'
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>' 
and many other Beat classics.  He's written books,
(for 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/hanuman/hb9.jpg">Hanuman</A>,
Cherry Valley Editions, etc.), but I'd personally 
never read any of them, and I sort of casually dissed
him as a writer in my
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke</A>
biographical page here at LitKicks.  Benjamin Schafer, who
worked hard putting this book together, asked
me to put aside my preconceptions and give Huncke a
fair reading for the first time.  He pointed out a few pieces 
for me to read, and I began with 'The Magician,' a haunting, 
honest tale of heroin addiction that reads like a Buddhist parable.  
I also tried, at his recommendation, 'Beware of Fallen Angels,'
'Faery Tale' and 'Easter', and the long autobiographical novella,
'The Evening Sky Turned Crimson.'  And, okay, I admit it: 
Huncke is a talented writer, and obviously took the 
craft seriously.  His picturesque slice-of-life
tales express with honesty and humor the state of mind of 
the City Hobo: junk-sick,
impoverished, stripped completely naked of his own morals.
This theme reverberates in the writings of 
William S. Burroughs,
as well as movies like 'Midnight Cowboy' and the songs of 
Glen Campbell (just kidding about the Glen Campbell part).<P>

If you are interested in the roots of the Beat Generation 
-- it was Huncke, by the way, who introduced Kerouac to 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatEtymology.html">the term 'Beat'</A>
-- you don't want to miss this book.<P>

3. Speaking of Kerouac -- he's all over the place
lately.  This month is the 40th Anniversary of the
publication of 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>,'
and a 40th anniversary edition of the book has been published, 
along with some other fanfare.  More interestingly,
Viking Penguin has finally published an unseen Kerouac work
of major importance: 'Some Of The Dharma.'  It's a thick
hardcover volume of Kerouac's notes and musings about
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhism</A>,
and stylistically it's somewhere between a Joycean 
literary experiment and a personal
journal about the tragicomic spiritual condition of 
mankind.  It has no plot, almost no
characters or dialogue, and the sentences are laid 
out like free verse.
This book is not for everybody, but 
I've been skimming several of its hidden surfaces for a 
few weeks now, 
and I haven't run out of interesting discoveries yet.  Among
other things, we know now the origin of the phrase "God Is Pooh Bear"
from the last paragraph of 'On The Road': Cathy Cassady,
the daughter of 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal</A>
and 
<A HREF="../People/CarolynCassady.html">Carolyn Cassady</A>,
said it when she was a few years old.<P>

Other Kerouac web news: there's now an online version of
Paul Maher's Lowell-based
<A HREF="http://www.freeyellow.com/members/upstartcrow/KerouacQuarterly.html">Kerouac Quarterly</A>,
and there's a new permanent web page to describe the annual
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/LCKerouac/">Lowell Celebrates Kerouac</A>
festival which takes place this weekend.   
Still no news of the Francis Ford Coppola 
<A HREF="../Topics/CattleCall.html">film of 'On The Road'</A>,
and I'm figuring this film will never get made.  One 
film that will get made, though, and which I'm really looking
forward to, is a Burroughs-related project, partly based on
the novels 'Queer' and 'Junky,'
that will be directed 
by Steve Buscemi (I wrote about this in a previous 
Beat News entry, below, and have since gotten word that the
project is still on and gathering steam).<P>

3. Other new books: 
'A Far Rockaway of the Heart' by
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</A>
(whose City Lights bookstore finally has a 
<A HREF="http://www.citylights.com/">web site</A>!).
'A Different Beat: Writings By Women of the Beat Generation'
is another spin on the theme begun by last year's excellent
"Women Of The Beat Generation" anthology published by 
Conari Press.  This book is written by Richard Peabody and
published by High Risk Books; I just bought it so I don't
know if it's good or not, but it has writers like 
Carolyn Cassady,
Elise Cowen, 
<A HREF="../People/DianeDiPrima.html">Diane Di Prima</A>, 
Joyce Johnson, 
Hettie Jones,
<A HREF="../People/LenoreKandel.html">Lenore Kandel</A>,
Jan Kerouac, 
Janine Pommy Vega 
and 
<A HREF="../People/AnneWaldman.html">Anne Waldman</A>,
so I'm pretty damn sure I'll like it.<P>

Finally, my wife and I have both become incredibly
fascinated by the new edition of the Folkways' Records
'<A HREF="http://www.si.edu/folklife/folkways/harry.htm">Anthology of American Folk Music</A>',
originally compiled by Beat outer-orbit personality,
experimental filmmaker and all around strange-guy 
Harry Smith 
in 1952.  This thing is wild.  We see folk music
in it's rawest form: authentic jug bands,
porchlight crooners, church choruses, and 
numerous other characters from the
deep country, both white and black (you often
can't tell which), singing and talking in
a mega-hick vernacular as compelling as it is 
strange.  Many of these singers were the country-hobo equivalents
of the city-hoboes presented by writers like Herbert Huncke (above).
When these guys sing the blues, they sing the blues.<P>

This record was one of the first collections of folk
music available in public libraries, and as such played
an important role in the developing sensibilities of future
folk-rockers like Bob Dylan and Jerry Garcia.  
You can read more about this historic re-release in
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/5896.html">Wired News</A>

Forever</A>.<P>

5. Farewell -- one last time -- to Mother Teresa, Princess Diana and 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>.
<P>

<H3>August 3, 1997</H3>

I just heard the news that Burroughs has died.  More 
on this 
<A HREF="../BurroughsTribute.html">here</A>.<P>

<H3>July 2, 1997</H3>

1. I like almost any movie with Steve Buscemi in it.  He was Mr. Pink in 
'Reservoir Dogs' (remember this line? "It's the world's smallest violin, 
playing just for the waitresses").  I'd first noticed him a couple
of years earlier, playing the guy who gets shot in the foot in Jim
Jarmusch's 'Mystery Train' (Joe Strummer of the Clash is in those
scenes too).  Anyway, the point of all this is that I've 
just gotten a scoop, from a very
reliable source, that Steve Buscemi has met with 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>
to discuss the possibility of creating a major film on 
Burroughs' life, based on the novels
'Queer' and 
'<A HREF="../Books/Junky.html">Junky</A>.'<P>

2. I hear the new book of letters by Hunter S. Thompson is 
very good.  There seem to be a lot of good websites about Hunter
too, like
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/5752/">this one</A>.
Further along on the trail of 60's post-Beat legends, 
you may want to check out the new edition of
<A HREF="http://www.furious.com/perfect/">Perfect Sound Forever</A>, 
a musical outgrowth of the zine 
<A HREF="http://www.furious.com">Furious Green Thoughts</A>,
for a great double interview with
<A HREF="http://www.furious.com/perfect/tuli.html">Tuli Kupferberg</A>
and 
<A HREF="http://www.furious.com/perfect/sanders.html">Ed Sanders</A>
of the 
<A HREF="http://www.furious.com/perfect/fugs.html">Fugs</A>.
<P>

3. Am I allowed to plug 
<A HREF="http://www.coffeehousebook.com">my own book</A>
here?  It's called "Coffeehouse: Writings From The Web,"
and it contains 47 pieces of fiction and poetry my co-author 
(Christian Crumlish of
<A HREF="http://ezone.org/ez">Enterzone</A>)
and I selected from literary sites all over the web.  
Christian and I worked really hard putting this book 
together, and we think we've come up with something 
very good.  And our publisher is taking a big chance in 
working with us on this totally unproven concept,
and we'd like to prove to him that
we knew what we were doing all along by making sure we
sell a lot of copies!  So, if you know anybody who's 
interested in the topic of hypertext fiction or the
zine scene or any other aspect of the whole growing, 
thriving, multi-faceted world of the literary web, please
tell them about this book, and tell your bookstore
to order lots of copies!  The book should be out by late 
July.  Okay, I'm done plugging ... <P>

<H3>May 20, 1997</H3>

Sorry I've been away for a while.  Took a much-needed
"sanity break" away from cyberspace.<P>

1. I haven't reminded you recently to check out
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey's</A>
site.  You really should, because Kesey is a vibrant and original
thinker with a great sense of humor, and he's also got a good
<A HREF="http://www.key-z.com">official site</A>,
run by his son Zane Kesey.  And you especially
should visit now, because Ken and Zane and 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady's</A> 
son 
<A HREF="../JCI/JCInterview.html">John Cassady</A>
and a bunch of others just drove "the bus" (or some
reasonable facsimile thereof) to Cleveland for a ceremony
at the 
<A HREF="http://www.rockhall.com/">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</A>.
John and his girlfriend Pat and her brother Dan tell me they
had an amazing time, and I'm really jealous because I should've
gone but I just stayed at home.  Oh well ... we can all enjoy it 
<A HREF="http://www.intrepidtrips.com">vicariously</A>.<P>

2. Check out 
<A HREF="http://www.mouthalmighty.com">Mouth Almighty</A>,
an experimental record company, created in conjunction with
Mercury Records, and dedicated to the art of spoken word poetry.
This is partly the work of 
<A HREF="http://poetry.miningco.com/mbiopage.htm">Bob Holman</A>,
who may be downtown New York's most important poetry cheerleader
now that 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
is dead.  But the poetry spirit is still alive like crazy 
around New York -- there's the Nuyoricans and 
<A HREF="http://www.interport.net/~tribes">Tribes</A>
and the St. Mark's 
<A HREF="http://www.poetryproject.com">Poetry Project</A>,
and over in Brooklyn is McLean Greaves' gorgeous 
<A HREF="http://www.losnegroes.com">Cafe Los Negroes</A>.
Speaking of Brooklyn (and speaking of Ginsberg), I was at
Brooklyn College last week for a memorial to Ginsberg, who
was a professor there until the time of his death.  Here's
<A HREF="../Topics/HowIMetGinsberg.html">what I read</A>.<P>

3. I've recently exchanged a few emails with a fascinating
survivor of the Beat and post-Beat 1960's and 70's,
<A HREF="http://www.buchenroth.com/cplymell.html">Charles Plymell</A>.
His 1971 book "The Last of the Mocassins" has just been 
republished, and you can also experience his honest and fresh
voice at the site above, along with many photos and interesting
asides.<P>

4. The New Yorker wrote a really nice review of the Literary Kicks
<A HREF="../Denver/Denver.html">Neal's Denver</A> section in the
May 19th issue.  But do they publish my short stories?  Fuck no.  Speaking 
of short stories ... some of my more somber friends consider this 
beneath contempt, but I've been listening to 
<A HREF="http://www.phish.net">Phish</A>
a lot lately.  A real lot.  What this has to do with short stories is
that their bassist Mike Gordon just published a book of his own 
stories, which he'd been writing for the Phish zine 
<I>Doniac Schvice</I>.  And the stories are excellent!  
Just to give you an idea what Mike Gordon's strange
prose sounds like, here's the first paragraph of the first story
in the book: "As far as tykes go,
Johnald was a wee bit irregular.  For one thing, he had an amrope 
coming out of his head.  You may be wondering, 'What is an amrope?'
I won't piss on you for wondering that.  Actually it's like an antenna, 
but it's got some mold on it.  It's not something you buy at a store;
maybe you do buy it in a store."  <P>

Weird.  Kind of like ... like Richard Brautigan 
meets Tickle-me-Elmo.  It works for me. <P>

5. I've been putting together 
<A HREF="http://www.coffeehousebook.com">a book</A>
with Christian Crumlish of
<A HREF="http://ezone.org:1080/ez/">Enterzone</A>,
and it's coming out soon!  Till then, I'm going back on 
my sanity break -- see y'all when the doctors say it's
all right ...<P>
 
<H3>April 11, 1997</H3>

This has been a frustrating week for me, because my many life
responsibilities -- mainly my job, my family, and also an 
anthology of web fiction I've been working on that's way past 
deadline -- made it impossible for me to devote as much time 
as I wished I could to coordinating Allen Ginsberg memorial 
information, creating my 
<A HREF="../GinsbergTribute.html">tribute page</A> 
and updating its list of URL's, and, mainly,
answering the hundreds and hundreds of touching and fascinating
emails I received (which I'm still sorting through, and will
be, I think, for a while).<P>

Fortunately other web people were able to fill this gap.  This
includes all the people whose URL's are on my tribute page, but 
I'm particularly thinking of 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/corduroy">Critter</A>
and
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/mongobear/private/Ginsberg.html">Mongo Bearwolf</A>
whose page is particularly important as he is helping to coordinate
a National Day of Remembrance.  Check out this page and see if there
is an event near you!  Really ... for those of you who don't go to
a lot of poetry-related events ... GET OFF YR ASS AND GO!!!  It may
change your life.  You never know.  Myself, I'll be at the big New York
tribute at St. Mark's Church tomorrow, which should be a zoo, 
but will hopefully be good anyway.<P>

To all who shed tears -- and there were many, many, many who
shed tears -- love to you all, and remember to find ways to 
honor those you admire with your own personal greatness.<P>

<H3>April 5, 1997</H3>

Ginsberg died this morning.  Go 
<A HREF="../Ginsberg040597.html">here</A> 
for more on this.<P>

<H3>April 4, 1997</H3>

The latest word is that Allen Ginsberg had a stroke or some
other serious complication, following the news yesterday
that he is dying of cancer. <P>

Before this, I'd heard that he was back at home but having a rough 
time ... and writing poems, meditating and 
meeting with friends.  A guy named Sean wrote to me with a URL for an 
<A HREF="http://www.cpcug.org/user/pmcveigh/ginsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg Prayer Page</A>.
At this point it's just a few words in black text on a dark orange
background -- which is as good a prayer as any other -- and he
says he'll update it with news if and when there is more.<P>

Life goes on.<P>

<H3>April 3, 1997</H3>

I just heard some sad news: 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
has been diagnosed with an inoperable case of liver cancer.
Doctors expect the disease will be fatal within four to
twelve months.  More detailed information is available at
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/topframe/2950.html">Wired News</A>.<P>

<H3>February 28, 1997</H3>

1. There's an excellent article in the latest issue
of Shambhala Sun (a Buddhist journal emanating from
somewhere near 
<A HREF="http://www.naropa.edu">Naropa</A> 
in Boulder, Colorado) about the mountain cabin
where Jack Kerouac was a fire lookout during the mid
1950's.  He wrote about these spiritual retreats in the novels
'<A HREF="../Books/DharmaBums.html">Dharma Bums</A>'
(which ends with him ascending Desolation Peak)
and 'Desolation Angels' (which begins with him
descending it). It's fascinating to see pictures  
of the cabin and the mountain peaks, and to read an objective
account of this severely isolated spot.  As the author
of the article writes, "Thoreau at Walden was never
thrown back on himself to the degree Kerouac was here."
The article, sans photographs, can be found in the 
Archives section of the
<A HREF="http://www.shambhalasun.com">Shambhala Sun web site</A>.<P>

2. Speaking of Kerouac: if he were alive today, he'd be celebrating
his 75th birthday on Wednesday, March 12.  (And can you imagine what
a character he'd have turned into by now?  Would he have ever stopped
drinking?  Would he have any friends left?).  Anyway (getting back to 
reality), Stone Soup Poets of Boston will be sponsoring a celebration
of Jack's birthday at the Old West Church in Boston's Beacon Hill at 
8:00.  The featured event will be a reading by the fascinating poet
John Wieners and other writers and musicians.  Tickets only five bucks 
(cheap!), write to Jim at jd34248@aol.com for more info. <P>

Nearby in 
<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A>, 
the Kerouac contingent there will be gathering at the Dubliner on
197 Market Street to listen to jazz and poetry and, in their words,
toast Kerouac's Irish Connections.  Sounds like a crazy night
in Massachusetts this March 12.<P>

3. Water Row Books, one of the most authorative Beat-related bookstores
around, has just released 
'<A HREF="http://www.scairyhairy.com/beatspeak.html">Beat Speak</A> -- 
An Illustrated Beat Glossary circa 1956-1959' by Asleigh Talbot.  
The title might seem a little faddish but
the book is actually very gritty and double-edged, with a strong emphasis
on the hard drugs, lurid sex and police-paranoia that marked the Beat
community in its prime.  Definitely an interesting perspective.<P>

4. Oh yeah ... did you ever read those excellent in-depth interviews
with writers in the 
<A HREF="http://www.voyagerco.com/PR/">Paris Review</A>?  The
latest issue's interview subject is
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>.
Can't read it online though, so don't bother trying.<P>


<H3>January 29, 1997</H3>

1. As unbelievable as this may sound, we are about to see a new
book by J. D. Salinger.  Granted, J. D. Salinger is not a Beat
writer, and even trashed the Beats occasionally as crude 
pretenders (I think he was jealous of their fame, which came a
few years after his).  But in terms of sensibility and style,
I think books like "Catcher in the Rye" and "Franny and Zooey"
have an obvious proto-Beat essence.  Anyway, Salinger has been
practicing utter literary silence for decades, inspired at least
in part by his 
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhist</A> 
beliefs, and the news that he is allowing a new book to be
published is extremely surprising.  The book will be called
"Hapworth 16, 1924," and I understand it is a reworking 
of a short story the New Yorker published in 1965.  According to the
<A HREF="http://slf.gweep.net/~sfoskett/jds/">Bananafish Home Page</A>,
which has an excellent index of all Salinger's stories, this piece
does involve Seymour Glass and the Glass family (his recurring
characters, from "Franny and Zooey," among many other pieces).<P>

2. I've been writing about the progress (or lack thereof) of the 
Francis Ford Coppola 
<A HREF="../Topics/CattleCall.html">film of "On The Road"</A>
in these pages for two years now.  There's still no word, as
far as I know, about whether or not this film will ever get made
(and in fact that's fine with me, since as I've said before I
bet it would suck, despite Coppola's best intentions).  Anyway,
a different film involving the exploits of real-life "On The Road" 
character 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A> 
has just debuted at the Sundance Film Festival.  
<A HREF="http://www.kushner-locke.com/main/ffilm/suicide.html">The
Last Time I Committed Suicide</A> stars Keanu Reeves and is
based on some famous letters Cassady wrote about his sexual
misadventures.  I'm not sure if Keanu plays Cassady or not.  I hope
I'll get to see this film soon -- if anyone else sees it, please
send me a report.<P>

2. I really feel like a part of Beat history now.  Steve Silberman, an
editor at HotWired, interviewed
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
online a couple of weeks ago, and after the interview made Allen
sit through his first-ever tour of the World Wide Web.  Now, I've known
for a while that in Allen's personal pantheon computers stand somewhere
between Central American CIA operatives and stale bagels with week-old
lox ... but I've always wondered how he would react to my site
if he saw it.  Well, Literary Kicks was the first site Steve took him
to, and you can read about the experience in Steve's intro to the
<A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/club/special/transcripts/96-12-16-ginsberg.html">transcript</A> 
of the HotWired chat session.  <P>

3. "A Coney Island of the Mind," 
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti's</A>
collection of poems, has long been one of the most popular books of
Beat writing.  Soon, I hear, there will be a follow-up volume, 
beguilingly titled "A Far Rockaway of the Heart"</A>.  Since Far
Rockaway is in my hometown of 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn">Queens</A>, I'm particularly
pleased by this ...<P>

4. There are several new Beat Generation sites on the web, and while
I'm still struggling with time limitations in terms of checking out
and linking to all the worthy sites out there, I've tried to keep a 
fairly up-to-date list on my
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A> 
page.  Some notable links I've added or updated lately: 
David Eads' 
<A HREF="http://www.3-cities.com/~geets/home.htm">How To Speak Hip</A>,
Robert Cecil's 
<A HREF="http://www.golden.net/~rccecil">Beat site</A>,
and Christopher Ritter's impressive
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/">Bohemian Ink</A>.
There's also a new 1997 
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/cosmic/97dbr.html">Dharma Beats</A>
roster -- this is part of the 
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/cosmic/cba1.html">Cosmic Baseball Association</A>,
one of the more charming and unusual sites on the web.  Enjoy ... and
happy new year, everybody.<P>
