<H2>24 HOUR POETRY PARTY</H2>
Far be it from LitKicks to celebrate its 10th anniversary in a conventional way.  The festivities will take place right here at LitKicks.com, beginning at noon ET on Friday, July 23 and running straight through to noon ET on Saturday, July 24.  We will be celebrating the fun and diversity of the LitKicks community with a full day of intensive group writing, culminating in what we believe will be one incredible word mosaic (or "poem" if you prefer.)  The party will feature original contributions by special guests, including poets Michael McClure and Robert Creeley.<BR><BR>

We recommend that you start stocking up on coffee now.<BR><BR>
We have shut down the LitKicks boards in order to begin the transformation of the entire site into the 24 HOUR POETRY PARTY. We can't wait to get started and we really hope you'll be a part of this experiment.
<br><br>
If you'd like to prepare ahead of time, we'd like to ask you to practice working with rhyme and meter. Many of the activities we are planning for this party will involve contributing poetic fragments according to a specific request (for example, we may ask you to write lines containing exactly seven syllables that rhyme with 'rain' or 'door'). To best prepare yourself for this creative process, we'd like to ask you to read some excellent poetry today, and pay special attention to the rhythms and textures a good poet employs.
<br><br>
Important note: even if you have never written a line of poetry before, we hope you will contribute to this event. If you can talk and think, you have all the qualifications needed to write excellent poetry. If you haven't created a LitKicks membername yet, you will need one to participate -- <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/account.jsp">start here</a>.
<br><br>
Finally, if you're anywhere near New York City, please join us for a casual afterparty party at the Bowery Poetry Club this Saturday from 2 to 4 pm, where we'll read our newly invented 24 hour poem, play some music, have some fun and complain about lack of sleep.<BR><BR>

We're still on schedule for our September 2004 release of the book, and the more we work on it, the more excited we are about its utterly kickass nature.  Instead of revealing the title at this time, we're pleased to bring you this still-rather-obscured image of the cover for your viewing pleasure.
