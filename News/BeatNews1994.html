Beat News Archive: 1994</H1>

Ben Gallitz (bgallitz@earth.execpc.com) has sent me info about a new
Ginsberg film biography, "The Life And Times of Allen Ginsberg."  The
director is Jerry Aronson, and I'm not clear on whether this is a 
straight-to-video release or not.  A review in the Washington Post
criticized the film as too tame.  I'll let you know more after I either
see it or hear from someone who has.<P>

Three items today: <P>

1. A reliable source just whispered (can you whisper via e-mail?) the name 
Johnny Depp to me, referring to the casting of the still-mysterious Coppola 
film of "On The Road" (see below.)  I don't know which part Depp is being 
considered for, Sal Paradise or Dean Moriarty, but I think he'd be a good Sal.  
He had a sort-of lonely/lost quality in 'Edward Scissorhands' that I think
would fit well with the part.  I hope they don't do anything dumb like
cast him as Dean.  <P>

2. Check out Christian Crumlish's new Web hyperfiction (or
something) project, 
<A HREF="http://enterzone.berkeley.edu/Enterzone.html">Enterzone</A>.  
You know, I keep reading in the newspapers about sites like www.coca-cola.com
and www.ibm.com, and these articles ignore the fact that the Web is a 
vehicle for innovative creative expression.  I think Xian's new project
is helping to advance the creative Web to a new level.  You can find it
at http://enterzone.berkeley.edu/Enterzone.html.  <P>

3. <I>DHARMA beat</I>, the publication of the Jack Kerouac subterranean 
Information Society, is accepting contributions for the February '95
issue.  The editor of <I>The Kerouac Connection</I> has also sent me
his guidelines for contributors.  Click 
<A HREF="../Lists/KerouacPubs.html">here</A> 
for the details.<P>

Ginsberg's in the news a lot lately.  His new CD boxed-set 
'Holy Soul Jelly Roll'
was released, and it's an excellent package.  It includes a historic
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>'
recorded in 
<A HREF="../Places/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</A>
in 1956, a full 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Kaddish.html">Kaddish</A>,' 
and many other great poems.
Most of his best recent songs are also included here, along with some 
previously unreleased stuff featuring 
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/employees/howells/dylan.html">Bob Dylan</A>,
plus a smokin' live cut with The Clash.  Ginsberg's voice has a weird 
charm to it, and you can actually listen to him for pleasure if you're
in a certain mood -- though there are also some pieces here that would work
great if you want to end a party early.  <P>

There was also a ridiculous editorial in the New York Times criticizing
Ginsberg for selling his personal archives to Stanford University for 
something like 1.2 million dollars.  In an age when individuals are made to
feel puny next to the money-fed corporations that tower over us, I feel
personally thrilled whenever a person in the arts gets to cash in a little
bit.  I only hope Allen Ginsberg enjoys the money as much as possible.  And
really, I'd think the Times would have better things to do than take random
pot-shots at unsuspecting poets. <P>

<H3>Oct 20 1994</H3>

Just heard (from a rec.music.dylan regular) that Francis Ford Coppola
is going to be directing a film of 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>'.  
Wow.  I happen to love some of Coppola's movies, especially the 
first two 'Godfather' movies, so I'm not upset about this.  Well, I'm a 
<I>little</I> upset, but that's only because I've always dreamed of
directing this film myself.  I don't know anything about directing, so
granted this is a longshot.  But I'd stick real close to the book and 
make a great film.<P>

I <I>hate</I> it when a good book gets turned into a stupid film.  But 
Coppola was the one who filmed 'The Outsiders,' my favorite novel from ages
10 through 14 (along with 'Flowers For Algernon'-- remember that one?) and
he didn't screw that one up too bad.  The book was still better, but the 
film didn't totally suck.<P>

Here's who I think Coppola should cast:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Sal Paradise (Kerouac): Rob Lowe (I happen to think Rob Lowe's an 
underrated actor).
<LI>Dean Moriarty (Cassady): Woody Harrelson (a little too old, but there's
a physical resemblance to Cassady).
<LI>Marylou: I dunno, maybe that girl in the Aerosmith videos.  Has to be
somebody who looks kinda dumb.
<LI>Ed Dunkel: Nicholas Cage.
<LI>Old Bull Lee (Burroughs): I dunno, maybe Hunter S. Thompson would do a 
cameo.  Wouldn't that be cool?
<LI>Carlo Marx (Ginsberg): There's a guy in 'Kids in the Hall' who kinda looks
like Ginsberg.
<LI>Camille (Carolyn Cassady): Bridget Fonda.
<LI>Terry (the Mexican Girl): Maybe Sofia Coppola?  I liked her in Godfather Part III.
</UL>   

What are your ideas?  Let me know and I'll put any good ones up here.<P>
