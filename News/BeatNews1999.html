<H3>December 15, 1999</H3>

The new millennium is coming and ... novelist 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/heller.htm">Joseph Heller</A>
has died.  I recently reread Heller's classic World War II black comedy 
"Catch-22", and found it funny and rewarding -- a 
cry against conformist thinking that
stands alongside Kafka's "The Castle" and Orwell's "1984" and also seemed 
very much related to Ken Kesey's contemporaneous "One Flew Over 
The Cuckoo's Nest".  I'm sure this book will continue to be
read by generations to come.<P>

I was also sorry to hear of the ailing health of 
<A HREF="http://www.peanuts.com/">Peanuts</A>
creator Charles M. Schulz, who announced that he will no 
longer be creating new strips.  "Peanuts" was a part of America's
post-war countercultural consciousness as much as "Catch-22",
"Cuckoo's Nest" or even "Howl".   I always thought the 
little kids would have grown up to be beatniks ... Schroeder would
have moved on from Beethoven to Lennon and 
Dylan, and the way Linus always quoted scripture, I'm sure
he would have gotten into I Ching and Zen.  Charles Schulz 
never used the strip to air his political or societal 
beliefs -- but hey, we knew what he meant when
he named the bird "Woodstock". <P>

The new millennium is coming ... and if Charlie
Brown will really be gone, I think the 1950's 
are now truly over.  I wonder what will come next?<P>

Happy New Year everybody!  Literary Kicks will be
changing a lot soon.  See you on the other side ...<P>

The novelist
<A HREF="../People/PaulBowles.html">Paul Bowles</A>
has died of a heart attack at the age of 88.  He had earlier
this month been taken to a hospital in 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>
where he had lived since 1947.  Paul Bowles, an 
elegant expatriate with a refreshing tolerance
for human differences and frailties, was a
friend and inspiration to many of the younger Beat 
writers, like William S. Burroughs and 
Allen Ginsberg, who followed his direction in 
finding an oasis from overbearing Western
civilization in Tangier.<P>

<H3>November 5, 1999</H3>

I've written a lot here about
<A HREF="http://www.fmp.com/amram">David Amram</A>'s
appearances at poetry readings and events recently,
but now a more serious event has 
occurred.  The farmhouse where David lives with his
family, in Peekskill Valley just north of New York
City, has burnt down.  The house was not 
insured, the family is seeking shelter with
friends, and a fund has been set up for those
who want to help the situation with a small
(or large) contribution.   The mailing 
address is:<P>

David Amram<BR>
c/o Toshi and Pete Seeger<BR>
Box 431 <BR>
Beacon NY 12508<BR>
(checks made out to David Amram and marked "gift" are tax-deductible)<P>

I don't make a practice of mentioning 
fund-raising efforts
in these pages, but David is one of the most
generous and good-hearted people I've ever met,
and I know there are people out there who have
gotten a lot out of his music and would like
the chance to give something back now that it
is needed.  If you'd like to know about a benefit
performance that will take place somewhere early
next year, write to Brian Hassett at 
<A HREF="mailto:karmacoupe@aol.com">karmacoupe@aol.com</A>.
And, if you've never seen David sing
or play piano (or french horn, or guitar, or 
his collection of Native American flutes, etc.)
you can buy his excellent new CD, 
<I>'<A HREF="http://www.fmp.com/amram/southern_stories.html">Southern Stories</A>'</I>
and hear what everybody's been raving about.<P>

<H3>October 8, 1999</H3>

1. I'd always wanted to see a production of Beat poet 
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure's</A> 
controversial hippie-era-vintage play "The Beard", 
which was the subject of a famous 
Los Angeles censorship battle back when Ronald
Reagan was governor of California (other famous 
censorship targets in that era included "The Love Book" by 
<A HREF="../People/LenoreKandel.html">Lenore Kandel</A>).
The play has just been revived in a 
thoughtful new production by the venerable
<A HREF="http://www.lamama.org/">La Mama Etc.</A> 
theater in the East Village in New York, so 
I got my wish.<P>

I was curious to see, thirty years after the Los
Angeles police attempted in vain to shut the play 
down, just what the fuss had been about.  I 
was expecting something wildly offensive, and 
was surprised to find a quiet, subtly shaded and 
intelligent dialogue play about the different 
ways men and women approach sex.  There were only
two characters: an archetypal male played by an
actor who looked slighly like
Kid Rock wearing a cowboy outfit, and an archetypal woman 
who resembled Courtney Love 
in platinum-blonde mode.  This man and woman spend 
the entire play -- literally, the entire play -- 
philosophically debating whether or not they should 
have sex.  This might sound somewhat tedious 
(actually, it sounds like a lot of my dates 
when I was in college), but the concept is 
relevant enough to make it add up to a memorable 
statement, and an enlightening evening.<P>

In fact the primal battle between men and 
women is a familiar theme -- the play reminded
me especially of the cartoons of male and female
armies engaged in civil war that James Thurber used
to draw, and also of similar "symbolic" treatments
of the sexual dialectic like "No Exit" by Jean-Paul
Sartre (in which a triangle of three characters 
illustrate the theme) or "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf" by Edward Albee (which gives us two matched 
pairs, a total of four).  McClure keeps the 
concentration on the primal two.  His approach
to drama is cool and diagrammatic, with none of 
the emotional build-up and release of a 
Tennessee Williams or Arthur Miller play -- just
the endless Escher-like curving-back-upon-itself 
of the "big question", as the man and woman 
discuss it over and over and over (yeah, 
the more I think about it, this was a <I>lot</I>
like one of my college dates).  <P>

I'm happy to report that the iconic characters do have sex in 
the end, symbolically at least.  In the final moment 
before the curtain drops (actually there is no curtain, but 
whatever) the blonde woman acheives a blissful sonic orgasm.  
I admit to being slightly disappointed that she never took 
any of her clothes off (what's up with that?) and maybe some 
women in the audience were disappointed that Kid-Rock-Boy 
didn't either.  Pretty incredible to think that, back in
the sixties, they shut down a theatre for presenting
<I>ideas</I> about sex.  I think (I hope) we've come
a long way since then.<P>

If you can't come to New York City to see this play 
in person, check out the fragment of the script
on McClure's own excellent 
<A HREF="http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/mcclure/mcclurea.htm">web page</A>,
which also presents some of his interesting poetry.<P>

2. Holy Shit!  There's an amazing site of free 
literary MP3's at
<A HREF="http://www.mp3lit.com/">MP3Lit.com</A>.   
Everybody from Sylvia Plath to Nicole Blackman, 
Henry Rollins to Noam Chomsky to 
Mumia Abu-Jamal to Tom Wolfe.  A great selection, 
and a great public service.  The site is fairly new 
and should grow quickly, but I hope the interface 
remains as simple as it is now.  I'm looking 
forward to the upcoming "Loudmouth" section 
where unknowns can present their own fiction 
and poetry -- should be some interesting results 
there.  Do not miss checking this place out.<P>

3. The New York Mets are back in the playoffs for the 
first time since 1988 -- a very good sign for the coming 
millennium.  Literary Kicks says "Let's go Mets!"<P>

<H3>August 21, 1999</H3>

1. The 
<A HREF="../Events/BitterEnd.html">Literary Kicks Summer Poetry Happening</A>
at the Bitter End in New York City
turned out to be an amazing night -- read 
all about it and check out some pictures
<A HREF="../Events/Happening.html">here</A>.<P>

Also, Bob Holman was nice enough
to remember the event by putting up the words
spoken by Charles Plymell
<A HREF="http://poetry.about.com/library/weekly/aa072799.htm?pid=2734&cob=home">here</A>.<P>

2. Speaking of the Bitter End event 
(no, I can't seem to stop speaking of it), one 
of the reasons I'd thought to invite Lee
Ranaldo to participate in it was that he's
been working with Jim Sampas and 
<A HREF="http://www.rykodisc.com/">Rykodisc</A>
to collect some of 
Jack Kerouac's best unreleased recordings 
onto a CD.  The CD is 
a revelatory collection that anybody who is 
 interested in understanding Kerouac will want to hear.  While 
Kerouac's existing poetry albums are sometimes
hard to listen to (I always found them somewhat
stiff and difficult to enjoy compared to his
written work), these newfound recordings of Jack's are
charming, musically adventurous and surprisingly
satisfying.  Highlights include a plaintive
version of the pop standard 'Rain or Shine',
some complex verbal blues choruses set to music 
by David Amram, a 28-minute
prose reading from 'On The Road' and, to
top it all off, a rocker by Tom Waits with
Primus (yeah!).  This CD will be released in 
early September.<P>

3. 
'<A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181833">The Source</A>',
a well-researched and intelligent new documentary full-length
film about the origins of the Beat Generation and its main 
players, 
is coming out in a couple of weeks.  Directed by 
Chuck Workman (who also directed a movie about 
the Andy Warhol scene, 
'<A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0103008">Superstar</A>'
), the film focuses heavily on 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>,
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>,
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>
and 
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>, 
and tries hard to fairly represent many other writers.  It adds up
to an informative and breezily entertaining introduction
to this literary movement.  Among the good points: 
the facts are accurate (though the chronology gets confused),
and there are no boring talking-head shots of men 
in sweaters sitting in front of bookcases (thank God).  At
the same time I didn't find the film completely different
enough -- much of the footage was familiar, and the 
summary style was pretty much the same as that of all 
those $35 coffeetable books about 
the Beat Generation that keep popping up in bookstores, 
whereas I wished to be taken somewhere new, to see some
challenging connections made, either 
politically, spiritually, aesthetically or in any other
way.  A captivating filmed scene of actor John Turturro 
screaming the hell out of the great poem 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>'
in an urban schoolyard is probably as "out there" as the
movie ever gets, and this was for me the most memorable
moment in the film.  But even if 'The Source' 
sticks basically to the middle
of the road, the movie is well worth watching, and 
nobody will regret the time spent soaking in the familiar 
footage of our lovable literary stooges, one more time.<P>

4. And one lovable literary stooge who <I>never</I>
played it safe was underground poet 
<A HREF="../People/DALevy.html">d. a. levy</A>.  
I was happy to walk into Barnes and Noble recently and
see, next to all those coffeetable books, the
first trade edition collection of his works: 
' <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1888363886/o/qid=935289552/sr=8-2/002-7709289-5770039">The Buddhist Third Class Junkmail: The Art and Poetry of d. a. levy</A>,' 
edited by Mike Golden.  
This guy was weird and a true original -- check this shit out.  <P>

<h3>June 20, 1999</h3>  

<p>1. The late satirist/writer Terry Southern 
is the subject of a new website, 
<a href="http://www.terrysouthern.com/">terrysouthern.com</a>, 
composed by his son Nile Southern. It's good to be able to 
enjoy these great nuggets of late-period hipster 
culture (Southern wrote the screenplay for 
'<a href="../Films/EasyRider.html">Easy Rider</a>', 
among many other films and books). It's also nice 
to see a new trend growing: adult children of 
beat writers putting together websites as personal 
tributes to their parents (cf. 
<a href="http://www.jackmicheline.com/">jackmicheline.com</a> 
and Zane Kesey's 
<a href="http://www.key-z.com/">key-z.com</a>). 
Today is Father's Day -- so check out these links.</p>  <p>

2. The not-very prolific Buddhist/beat poet 
<a href="../People/PhilipWhalen.html">Philip Whalen</a> 
has a new book out: 'Overtime: Selected Poems'.</p>  <p>

3. If you can make it to New York City on July 21, come to 
<a href="http://www.bitterend.com/">The Bitter End</a> 
in Greenwich Village for a kick-ass poetry reading I'm 
putting together. The occasion is the 5th birthday, 
believe it or not, of this website. I'm putting this 
show together with my poet friend Brian Hassett, who 
arranged a couple of excellent shows I participated 
in earlier this year at the Living Room in the Lower 
East Side.</p>  

<p>One thing that made these shows so good was the 
presence of David Amram, an extremely talented and very 
serious musician who was Jack Kerouac's own piano player, 
back when Jack used to read poetry on stage. David 
generously offered to improvise behind a few of us 
less-seasoned neo-Beats as we read our own poems, 
and the amazing thing about the way he accompanies 
live poets is that he actually <i>listens</i> and 
plays according to what he hears -- no matter how 
humble or unimportant the reader or the words. He also 
does some songs of his own, and I'm very glad that 
he'll be at this event. Other special guests will include 
John Cassady, Neal's son, who'll be playing guitar and 
telling a story or two, poets Richard Hell, Lee Ranaldo, 
Ron Whitehead, Bob Holman, Herschel Silverman, Breath 
Cox and haiku master Cor van den Heuvel. And on the 
newer edge, representing the other side of Literary 
Kicks, I've invited a bunch of my webby friends to get 
on stage and kick some shit around -- Mark Thomas of 
Sorabji, Leslie Harpold of Smug, Christian Crumlish and 
Briggs Nisbet of Enterzone, Xander Mellish, Meg 
Wise-Lawrence and Phil Zampino. It's going to be 
a wild night -- 
<a href="../Events/BitterEnd.html">check out the program</a> 
and I really hope you can make it.</p>  

<h3>April 4, 1999</h3>  

<p>There's nothing like a good, well-managed and highly 
bizarre personal web content site. The following are 
some of my recent favorite sites, all of them run by 
individuals who embody Ralph Waldo Emerson's ideal of 
the 'self-reliant' artist. They create their web works 
for no reason other than to express the uniqueness 
of their own personalities. And none of them seem to 
care much if anybody likes what they do. The creative 
web is alive ...</p>  

<p>Let's start on the purely visual end of the spectrum, 
with the psychologically psychedelic art musings of 
Jef Morlan, a master of Macromedia Flash whose works 
are inspired by the Flemish artists of the Dutch 
Renaissance. Jef lives somewhere inside 
<a href="http://www.snarg.net/"><i>Snarg.net</i></a>, 
the site he has been building and rebuilding for 
the last several years.</p>  <p>Not much less weird 
is Mark Napier's 
<a href="http://www.potatoland.org/"><i>PotatoLand.org</i></a>. 
Where Jef Morlan uses Flash and digital video, Mark Napier's 
basic tool is the Java programming language, which he uses 
mainly to shred and disassemble the components of our 
familiar media world in as many ways as he can.</p>  

<p>Now let's leave the chilly realms of these two abstract 
visual artists and move towards the warmer, more 
internally introspective side of the spectrum. Drop by 
<a href="http://www.sorabji.com/"><i>Sorabji.com</i></a> 
to see what astute thoughts are currently engaging the 
cluttered mind of web innovator Mark Thomas, who seems 
to enjoy arranging odd interactions between people by 
listing pay telephone numbers, creating an infinite 
stream of querelous chat boards, and sneaking digital 
photographs of strangers on the street. His site 
gets a lot of message board traffic from readers, 
and he often keeps quiet for long stretches of time 
and lets them do all the talking, to good effect.</p>  

<p>Then, for a final dose of attitude, 
check out Leslie Harpold's 
<a href="http://www.smug.com/"><i>Smug.com</i></a>.</p>  

<h3>February 28, 1999</h3>  

<p>I go a long way back as a 
<a href="http://www.richardhell.com/HellBio.html">Richard Hell</a> 
fan. I was lucky enough to have been a Long Island high 
school kid during the great punk era of late 70's New York 
City, and every time I could scrape ten bucks together 
I'd jump on the Long Island Railroad to Manhattan, 
walk down to the Village and sneak into bars like CBGB's and 
Max's Kansas City and Irving Plaza where I could catch 
bands like the Ramones, the Mumps, the B-52's and Richard 
Hell and the Voidoids. Richard Hell was one of my 
favorites, a tormented poet bristling with a romantic 
punk anger that seemed somehow 
rooted in a dark European mood of 
absinthe and Symbolism, who yelled bleary angry 
lyrics to a hypercharged angular minimalist 
pogo beat, catchy and violent and loud, even 
good fun power pop within all the obvious anger. 
These were amazing nights; I caught about ten Voidoids shows 
during these years, and when their album 'Blank Generation' 
came out I played it constantly and loved it. 
But they never really crossed-over and 
became a big hit like the 
Ramones or Blondie or Talking Heads. </p>  

<p>Then the 80's began. Reagan became President, 
MTV was invented, the culture of money-style 
replaced the culture of art-style in New York City, 
and Richard Hell was gone from public view. I was in 
college during these years, and I wasn't listening to 
Hell much any more. I soon started forgetting to even 
remind myself to remember Richard Hell or the Voidoids, 
and then eventually like a stuffed animal left at 
home I came to forget them completely.</p>  

<p>Then around the mid-90's Hell suddenly resurfaced -- 
still living in New York City, still looking drugged-out 
and underfed and tired and angry, in fact looking not 
much different than he'd looked before. Except now he 
was the author of a brilliant, sparklingly well-written 
first novel, 'Go Now', which had somehow been published 
not by some downtown indie zine shop (which is what 
anyone would have expected for Hell) but by an imprint 
of the refined mass-market publishing conglomerate 
Simon and Schuster. The novel, a semi-autobiography 
in a neo-Beat flavor, even got excellent reviews 
in respectable magazines and newspapers. I have 
no idea how Hell pulled this marketing coup off, 
except that the book was good enough to deserve 
every bit of attention it got. Maybe quality and 
artistic integrity really <i>does</i> still count for 
something in large-corporate publishing (though there 
aren't many other indications of this these days).</p>  

<p>But will 'success' go to Richard Hell's head? 
No fucking way. He helps to run CUZ Editions, 
his own indie publishing shop, and he produces 
occasional strange, appealing literary experiments 
like a recent book of poetry in which every page 
is a slightly different version of the same single, 
simple poem. You can find out more about 
this and other stuff at the 
<a href="http://www.richardhell.com/">CUZ website</a>. 
There's also an interesting recent interview with 
Hell in the music zine 
<a href="http://www.furious.com/perfect/richardhell.html"><i>Perfect Sound Forever</i></a>.
</p>  

<h3>February 2, 1999</h3>  

<p>1. Lots of people have heard about the excellent 
Kurt Vonnegut graduation speech that got sent all over the 
internet last year before everybody figured out that 
Vonnegut never gave the speech. But here, and also pretty good, is 
<a href="http://www.duke.edu/~crh4/vonnegut/ginsberg.html">something Kurt Vonnegut actually did say</a>. </p>  

<p>2. If you're in New York: there'll be a big Burroughs 
tribute bash Saturday, Feb 5 at 1 pm at St. Mark's Church 
in the East Village, with folks like Steve Buscemi, Richard 
Hell, Barry Miles, Maggie Estep, James Graueurholz reading. 
Then on Wednesday, Feb 10 at 7:30, there'll be a big messy 
Kerouac bash at the Living Room on 84 Stanton St in 
Soho, with readings by folks like Ann Douglas, 
David Amram, David's daughter Adira Amram, Frank Messina, 
Brian Hassett and me.</p>  

<H3>January 8, 1999</H3>  

<p>Sorry I've been away so long. I've been taking a 
break, but I promise soon I'll be my old chatty 
self again.</p>  

<p>Not much to report here anyway. The music/poetry 
duo of former Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek and 
<a href="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</a> 
is hitting the road again, and I'm looking forward to 
seeing them play the Bottom Line here in New York City 
next Tuesday, January 12. There's also a new 
<a href="http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&amp;d/mcclure/mcclure.htm">website</a> 
devoted to McClure, which he participated in creating.</p>  

<p>Also, it looks like James Grauerholz did an awesome 
job in putting together the most comprehensive 
collected edition of writings by 
<a href="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</a>. 
The book is called 
'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802116299/qid=915835982/sr=1-1/002-6353976-6729062">Word Virus</a>', 
and it's good stuff. I'm going into hiding 
again, be back soon ...</p>
