BORN AGAIN!<P>
<I>by Ray Bremser</I><P>

. . . <BR>
we took the first road on our left,<BR>
pointed ourselfs to the gulf<BR>
& fled thru the falling valleys into<BR>
the tropic & lowland plains,<BR>
where the jaguar retches & Panfillo<BR>
Navarez got his copper-sheathed ass<BR>
nipped at, after the crocs & moccasined<BR>
Zipotecan active cannibals, who<BR>
tip their stings & darts w/curare,<BR>
found cause for concern with the<BR>
obsidian barbarians the whole<BR>
conquistadores  were . . .<BR>
=====<BR>
the truck makes a racous<BR>
clattering up rocky roads,<BR>
picking up gears<BR>
on into the rarified heights--<BR>
10 thousand feet up the mountain<BR>
which delayed Malinche<BR>
on his freaked-out march to<BR>
kill & capture the aztec empire,<BR>
destroy all the toltec art,<BR>
smach the olmec urns & statuary,<BR>
all in museums now / little bits and pieces<BR>
for man to contemplate their lost glory,<BR>
much like the dinosaurs --<BR>
<BR>
up this very same road, under these very same stars,<BR>
when it was jungle below & a forest of<BR>
tropical fruits above.<BR>
<BR>
& even then, a way, way up in the blue-black site,<BR>
hovering at the perigee, ten thousand warm young<BR>
tropical breezes,<BR>
kissed the conquerors fingers, old fingers<BR>

Yesterday, as Ray Bremser lay dying in a 
Utica (upstate New York) hospital, Ray's friend and fellow poet
<A HREF="http://www.buchenroth.com/cplymell.html">Charlie Plymell</A>
e-mailed me this poem, which I hope he doesn't mind me 
posting here.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
November 3, 1998 Dark Afternoon<BR>
<BR>
November,<BR>
and the clouds are heavy metal<BR>
rolling oe'r the vacant brick of Utica<BR>
where Ray lies in his death throes<BR>
at the Faxton Cancer Hospital.<BR>
<BR>
It's not a happy sight, a <BR>
finality about the rooms and service<BR>
his roommate's exposed privates<BR>
both he and Ray seem far away.<BR>
<BR>
In and out of sensed reality<BR>
I fear to say, eyes like animals in cages<BR>
Ray's eyes sometimes intense<BR>
screaming "I want to die"<BR>
not in a philosophical mode<BR>
but the growl used for prison guards<BR>
rattling his bones against the <BR>
iron bars of  New Jersey.<BR>
<BR>
Squirts of daylight on the sidewalk<BR>
like used rubber gloves thrown<BR>
among the slimy Autumn leaves<BR>
Study the sight, oh latter night Beats.<BR>
<BR>
Another is passing into the night<BR>
like T.V. tonight Jimmy Smit <BR>
on NYPD the line of fictive reality<BR>
unto death, what to do with life's purpose?<BR>
If it's to understand life (loved the old comedies)<BR>
from those eyes just make ourselves over<BR>
Ray watch the old realities in black and white<BR>
He pulls on the bed rails : "I want to die."<BR>
His eyebrows move and he briefly conducts<BR>
a conversation he can't partake in<BR>
or a  Katchaturian concert or a poem.<BR>
He leans back, eyes glazed, goes elsewhere<BR> 
further than shooting up decades ago<BR>
the history gone like our rides for Terpin hydrate<BR>
finding village drugstores while the world went on.<BR>
<BR>
What history can a human have. The history gone<BR>
the religions, the politics, the last fiction...not that<BR>
Faith, miracles, and belief isn't real<BR>
there's just never enough to go around. <BR>

Ray Bremser was born on February 22, 1934 in Jersey City.<P>


<H3>October 29, 1998</H3>

1.  A lot of Beat history happened at the
<A HREF="http://www.evergreenreview.com/">Evergreen Review</A>,
a long-running indie literary journal created 
to represent the underground literary scene of the 
late 50's (heavy on Sartre and Beckett as well
as Kerouac and Genet).
They now have a website worthy of their legacy.  
I especially like surfing around the cleanly designed, unpretentious 
<A HREF="http://www.evergreenreview.com/archive/past.html">archive section</A>. <P>

2. Historian/writer Douglas Brinkley, author of the 
Cassady/Kesey-inspired travel book "The Majic Bus" 
and editor of Hunter S. Thompson's
recent book of letters, seems to be doing a pretty good job
as the estate-appointed compiler of the Kerouac papers.  He
leaked a few selections from the Kerouac archive to the 
<A HREF="http://www.theatlantic.com/">Atlantic Monthly</A>,
which even put Jack on the cover of the current issue (NOTE:
this never would have happened when Jack was alive -- that's
what the Evergreen Review was for).  Anyway, Brinkley
selected some good stuff.  Here's Jack complaining to
the editor of his novel "Subterraneans" about revisions 
to his manuscript:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> "I can't possibly go on as a responsible prose 
artist and also a believer in the impulses of
my own heart and in the beauty of pure spontaneous
language if I let editors take my sentences, which
are my phrases that I separate by dashes when "I draw
a breath," each of which pours out to the tune of the
whole story its own rythmic yawp of expostulation, & riddle
them with commas, cut them in half, in three, in fours, ruining
the swing, making what was reasonably wordy prose even more
wordy and unnaturally awkward (because castrated).  In fact
the manuscript of <I>Subterraneans</I>, I see by the photostats, 
is so (already) riddled and buckshot with commas and marks I 
can't see how you can restore the original out of it.  The act
of composition is wiser by far than the act of after-arrangement,
"changes to help the reader" is a fallacious idea prejudging 
the lack of instinctual communication between avid scribbling
narrator and avid reading reader, it is also a typically
American business idea like removing the vitamins out of rice
to make it white (popular)."</BLOCKQUOTE>

Yeah!  Jack, you tell them.<P>

3. I get a lot of e-mail from lots of countries, but I get a special
kick out of it when, for instance, somebody translates Ginsberg,
Ferlinghetti and Kerouac into 
<A HREF="http://www2.egenet.com.tr/~balkose/beats.html">Turkish</A>.
<P>

4. Lots and lots of Beat movies are "in development", as they say
in Hollywood.  Francis Ford Coppola's proposed film of 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>'
is still being discussed, and, yes, they are considering casting
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (from "Good Will Hunting") as Sal and Dean.  I
assume Matt would play Dean and Ben would play Sal.  I just hope Robin
Williams stays the hell out of it.<P>

Anyway, the Damon/Affleck thing is far from a done deal, just
something being bandied about.
A new screenplay for 'Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test' is also
in the idea stage.  I think this could
be an amazing movie if done well.  I vote for Woody
Harrelson to play 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>,
but I can't think of anybody who'd be right to play 
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey</A>
-- yeah, I know, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (whoever 
doesn't get to play Kesey can be Babbs).  I'm
just not sure about it.<P>

In all seriousness, though, I hope this film gets
made, but it probably doesn't portend well that 
Hunter S. Thompson's
'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', a book about the
same era, with a similar sensibility, 
bombed at the box office.  This may scare off some 
of the bean-counters out there
on the 'Digital Coast'.<P>

There are also still machinations behind the proposed Steve Buscemi
film based on William S. Burroughs' two novels 'Queer' and
'<A HREF="../Books/Junky.html">Junky</A>', and
I really hope this one happens.  I saw an early version of
this screenplay and it was excellent.  I also hear that
a movie about the early days of Ginsberg, 
Burroughs,
<A HREF="../People/LucienCarr.html">Lucien Carr</A>
and company is being proposed.  The tentative title
is 'Beat' -- real original, guys.  Then again, it's
a better title than 
'<A HREF="../Films/LastTimeICommittedSuicide.html">Last Time I Committed Suicide</A>'.<P>

Forget all this Hollywood/Sundance bullshit for a minute, though,
and let's just take a minute to think about an obscure 64-minute
movie made by a certain poor aspiring filmmaker somewhere in the 
outer buroughs of New York City, a
<A HREF="../Topics/CattleCall.html">failed actor</A>
who had to work as a software engineer to support
his lifelong dream that he could make a movie of his very own.
This young man had no agent, no budget, 
no equipment -- just a Macintosh, some 
expensive software of dubious license-status, and a bunch of 
friends willing to be videotaped doing stupid things in public.
And this pathetic, lonely would-be <I>auteur</I> slaved away two 
hard years making this movie, 
all the while also slaving away maintaining his website (fixing
spelling errors, etc., which is hard work) and now, finally,
after all this work, the movie has been released on CD-Rom and
is on sale for only $12.00.  Let's talk about this for a minute.<P>

Because, in case you haven't guessed yet, that filmmaker is 
<A HREF="../HomePages/LeviAsher.html">me</A>.
My modern-dress version of
'<A HREF="../Notes/">Notes From Underground</A>' 
has been out for a couple of months now, and I've
gotten really excellent feedback on it.  I've just
finished switching credit card vendors so that people
who tried to buy it online and couldn't get through
earlier this month
should no longer have any trouble.  So what the
hell are you waiting for?  Get your ass 
<A HREF="../Notes/">over there</A> 
and buy a copy.  It's Dostoevsky.  It's good
for you.<P>

<H3>September 21, 1998</H3>

1.  Congratulations to 
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</A>,
the new poet-laureate of 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>.
This is a cool move on San Francisco's part, and I dare New York
City to match it.  I think 
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>
is available.<P>

2. Speaking of the old Beat crowd, some good new 
material has surfaced lately.  I recently received some 
beautiful photographic prints from
<A HREF="http://www.kerouac.com/photosbiography.htm">Larry Keenan</A>.
They are for sale at reasonable prices
<A HREF="http://www.kerouac.com/photos.htm">here</A>.<P>

<A HREF="../People/JanKerouac.html">Jan Kerouac's</A>
two long out-of-print autobiographical novels, 
"Baby Driver" and "Trainsong," have just been republished in 
new paperback editions.  These books are written very much
in her father's style, and it's ironic that Jack 
Kerouac never got to enjoy hanging out with his 
only daughter, because they both obviously had similar ideas about how to 
live: like Roman candles, with big emphasis on the 
poignancy of the burn-out.<P>

<A HREF="../People/DianeDiPrima.html">Diane DiPrima</A>, 
on the other hand, has never been accused of poignancy.  This poet sings 
out in a major key, brazen and proud as hell.  Her autobiographical 
"Memoirs of a Beatnik", which has also just been republished 
in paperback, is not the wan, soft-toned, gently nostalgic 
memoir one would expect, but instead a ribald, sexually detailed 
accounting of her bedroom adventures with a series of Greenwich
Village hipsters and Zen writers including, among them, the
poignant Jack Kerouac.  The book is great fun, even if it sometimes reads
more like "Penthouse Forum" than like an autobiography.<P>

It's more fun, anyway, than that inept attempt at soft-core porn
known as "The Kenneth Starr Report".  You know (if I may
stray onto a different subject) I endorsed
Bill Clinton for President in these pages back in 
<A HREF="../News/BeatNews1996.html">1996</A>, 
not because I thought he was anything close to perfect, but 
mainly because I found him much more down-to-earth 
than the smarmy, patriarchal right-wing bores who preceded 
him.  Remember George Bush, Bob Dole and Ronald Reagan?  
I went to college during the Reagan presidency, and I'll tell you,
after eight years of Ron and Nancy on TV (followed by four of
George and Barbara), Bill and Hillary Clinton arrived like a 
breath of fresh air.  I liked it that they read books, and knew 
something about good music (not much, but something), and 
that Hillary seemed to have a brain of her own (like I said,  I'd 
just spent four years watching George and Barbara
on TV, and eight with Ron and Nancy.  That shit
was cornier than "Father Knows Best"). <P>

Now Bill and Hillary have run into rough times, and I just
want to say from my humble little 
portal here that I support and respect 
them as much as ever.  I refuse to pretend
to be shocked at the discovery that Bill Clinton has a few
human flaws. "She removed her blouse and he 
fondled her breasts."  Yeah, yeah ... don't 
you Republicans have work to do? <P>

I propose that Kenneth Starr, 
<A HREF="http://www.salonmagazine.com/news/1998/09/cov_16newsb.html">Henry Hyde</A>
and all their cronies be indicted for wasting ridiculous
amounts of taxpayer's money composing bad porn.  I mean,
a cigar ... where do they get off publishing shit like this?  
Since when does America have Sex Police?  And if we're all 
laying our cards on the table, I'd like to hear George 
Bush swear that he didn't have any extramarital affairs 
while he was President or Vice-President.  Come on, 
George ... America is listening.<P>

What you hear now is the sound of uncomfortable 
squirming from somewhere around Kennebunkport, 
Maine.  End of editorial.<P>

<H3>August 3, 1998</H3>

1.  Okay, goddammit, my new
<A HREF="../Notes/">CD-Rom movie</A> 
is finally done, and I'm giving away 750
copies starting tomorrow, Tuesday August 4, beginning
at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time.  You can 
get one by filling out
<A HREF="../Notes/BetaForm.html">this form</A>,
which will remain up until all the copies are gone.
I'm hoping to get feedback on the movie which will
help me iron out any technical bugs before I officially release
the CD-Rom in October (it will sell for $12).  If you
get a copy before then, please remember to fill out my 
<A HREF="../Notes/Feedback.html">Feedback form</A>.<P>

2.  There's going to be a big Beat party at the site of a
legendary hippie/beatnik commune in 
<A HREF="http://www.cherryvalley.com/">Cherry Valley</A>
this weekend.  I'll be there, and I'm looking forward to 
meeting
<A HREF="http://www.buchenroth.com/cplymell.html">Charlie Plymell</A>
and a lot of other people.
If you're there and you recognize
me from 
<A HREF="../HomePages/LeviAsher.html">my picture</A>
please say hello!  The weekend is officially some kind of town 
<A HREF="http://www.cherryvalley.com/x/cv/?Action=ArtsFestival&&userid=">Arts Festival</A>
but from what I hear it's going to be one big party.<P>

3.  The publishers of a new biography of Jack Kerouac, 
"Subterranean Kerouac" by Ellis Amburn, are indulging in 
a bit of sensationalism by trying to sell the book as a "tell-all" 
revealing Jack's alleged deep dark secret, which is that he 
was bisexual.  I have a couple of points to make about this 
deep dark secret:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>
Virtually every biography of Jack Kerouac, from Ann Charters'
"Kerouac" in 1973 to Gerry Nicosia's "Memory Babe" and most of 
the others in between, mention that Jack had bisexual tendencies.
So why all the publicity now? It's well documented, for 
instance, that a drunken Jack Kerouac once
had a spontaneous fling with Gore Vidal (an openly gay writer) in a 
Manhattan hotel, and was later found in a crowded bar yelling
"I blew Gore Vidal!".  So a new book revealing the stunning
secret that Kerouac was bisexual is about as necessary as a new book 
revealing the stunning secret that Bill Clinton fools around with White
House interns.<P></LI>

<LI>Here's what the evidence tells us about Kerouac's sexual
inclination, if anybody cares.  Unless he was lying to his 
readers, to the friends he wrote letters to, and even to 
himself in his journals, he mostly felt attracted to women.
He fell in love with them often, married twice, and yearned for
female companionship when he didn't have it.  As he documents 
in autobiographical novels like 
<I>Subterraneans</I>
and 
<I><A HREF="../Books/BigSurBook.html">Big Sur</A></I>,
he wasn't the smoothest lover in the world, or the most secure.
He seemed to have a hell of a lot
of what my wife would call "issues", and especially
seemed to resent the power women had over him because
of his attraction to them.  He also had at least some
capacity for attraction to men, or at least an 
open-minded attitude about men as sexual partners.
He hung out with a lot of literary and artistic types in
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">Greenwich Village</A>
and 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>,
and so was surrounded by gays and grew
to feel comfortable experimenting with his own gay tendencies,
whatever they were.<P>

To twist these facts around and
try to portray Kerouac as deeply repressed by a secret buried
desire for men is disingenuous. Like I said, this is a man who
once announced "I blew Gore Vidal!" in a crowded bar.
Doesn't sound very repressed to me.<P>

The worst thing about the depiction
of Kerouac as tormented by a buried sexual 
desire is that it leads to a reinterpretation 
of his writing that trivializes some of his 
best work.  I don't believe that
<I><A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A></I>
was secretly about Sal Paradise's attraction to
Dean Moriarty, and I also don't think this idea
illuminates the book in any way.
It's like the supposed "discovery", a few
years ago, that Van Gogh used so much yellow in his paintings 
because he suffered from an obscure eye disease.  I like to think
Van Gogh used so much yellow because it meant something.  If it was
just an eye disease, then it's not art.<P></LI>

<LI>There have been about sixty new books about Jack Kerouac in the
last eight months, and I really, really just don't think the world needs 
any more new books about Jack Kerouac.  Really.  No, <I>really</I>.<P></LI>
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Oh, I forgot to say, about being gay: "Not that there's anything wrong 
with that!"  No, really.<P>
 
<H3>July 23, 1998</H3>

Damn!  My new project won't be ready till August 4.  On that date, I'll be
giving away 750 free test copies of my new CD-Rom movie, so please try to 
come back around then.  Right now all I can offer is a sneak
<A HREF="../Notes/">peek</A> 
at the website (if you don't mind some broken links).<P>

Bringing a creative idea to completion is never easy.
While I work myself to exhaustion finishing
my little indie project, you can enjoy checking out 
<I><A HREF="http://doctechnical.com/seemreal/">Neal Amid</A></I>, 
a wildly anarchic comic tribute to the Neal 
Cassady legend, created by Cat Simril,
who actually *did* finish it and sent me a copy as 
proof.  "Neal Amid" is a sound play on audiocassette, very much
in the spirit of old Firesign Theatre or Monty Python comedy records, and 
the plot revolves around a 60's-era Neal figure whose spirit is 
somehow intersecting with that of the Grateful Dead during their 
1978 visit to Egypt, where they played a series of concerts in front of the
Pyramids.  The cassette's wonderful cover photo illustrates the cosmic
sense of this notion better than I can explain it.  Order a copy -- 
you gotta love it.<P>

And please come back August 4 ... see you then ...<P>

<H3>June 21, 1998</H3>

1.  There aren't too many commercially-funded webzines I respect.  Often
a perfectly good author will become intimidated and creatively stunted when
writing for a webzine with "a business model," and will begin churning out
dull, ironic, high-handed musings about the effects of Monica Lewinsky and 
Ginger Spice on American culture, instead of anything original or 
interesting.  <P>

But a couple -- not many, but a couple -- of these zines have a clue.
<A HREF="http://www.nerve.com/">Nerve</A>,
for instance, keeps itself fresh and interesting by focusing with narrow-minded
intensity on a single taboo subject -- sex, in all it's creative, artistic
and literary manifestations.  This is a commercial website, finally, with a 
true reason to exist.  And now Nerve has proven itself worthy of its name by 
publishing Steve Silberman's
'<A HREF="http://www.nerve.com/silberman/allensboys/">Allen's Boys</A>',
an honest, personal discussion of
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>'s famous and
much-criticized sexual habits, which included lots of questionable
activities with handsome young men.  
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/digaland/">The author</A> 
of this article was not Ginsberg's lover but once 
could have been, and he blasts through
a lot of taboos in laying down this soul-searching short memoir.
Ginsberg took a lot of abuse for his beliefs about open sexuality,
especially since he practiced what he preached, and I'm glad somebody
finally wrote an intelligent, non-judgmental article about this difficult
subject.<P>

2. I've been holed up working on my secret project -- a CD-Rom movie
based on a well-known Russian 19th Century novel -- for
a long time now, and I'm finally almost finished.  Please check
back with me around July 23 for the big unveiling ...<P>

<H3>May 5, 1998</H3>

I've been suffering from Beat literature burnout lately.  
I knew it was bad when Bravo ran two
documentaries on Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac and I
couldn't work up enough interest to watch them.<P>

I was in a skeptical mood, as usual, on 
April 18 when I dropped by the Knitting Factory, a
fashionable downtown New York hangout, for an all-day 
reading to honor
<A HREF="../People/JackMicheline.html">Jack Micheline</A>.
The room was packed, and I grouchily wondered if 
Micheline would have drawn such a large and adoring
crowd if he were still alive and able to borrow money.
But my defenses were broken immediately when Jack Micheline's
son stepped up to make a speech.  A clean-cut and polite 
adult who seemed to have suffered no scars from having an 
impoverished Beat poet for a father, he even cared enough
to have created a new website,
<A HREF="http://www.jackmicheline.com/">JackMicheline.com</A>,
in his father's honor.  He held his young daughter in his arms
and said she was what Jack Micheline had been proudest of at
the end of his life.  Okay, dammit, I was touched.<P>

Then a young independent filmmaker named Laki Vazakas
invited me to a screening of his new movie about
the late 
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke's</A>
stormy relationship with a younger and more 
troubled companion, Louis Cartwright.  Both Huncke and
Louis were lifelong heroin addicts, occasionally switching
to methadone maintenence or other substitutes, but in any
case the routine of drug acquisition seemed to have ruled
their lives completely.  The film was shot with a handheld
videocamera in their Chelsea Hotel apartment and other
locales, without a plan or a script.  Unlike the
characters in MTV's "The Real World", though, Huncke and Louis
were often too strung out and world-weary to play to
the camera, and so the movie is filled with startlingly honest 
moments.  Louis clowns happily in the early scenes, but then begins to
slip into a drug burnout so devastating that even Huncke is
forced to separate from him, and finally the camera catches
Louis crying and alone, hiding in a dark apartment unwilling
to face the beautiful weather outside.  Finally he is murdered
on a Lower East Side street, and we see the most startling
image of all: a naked, aged, skeletal Huncke sobbing 
uncontrollably for his lost friend, groping for
an understanding of what has happened.  I hope "Huncke and Louis"
finds its way to some kind of distribution deal; till then, if 
you're around New York City there'll be another screening on 
May 8 at the NYU Film Series, and hopefully more after that.  
Check the 
<A HREF="http://www.channel1.com/users/adamsky/hunckelouis.htm">website about the film</A>
for more info.<P>

The night of the "Huncke and Louis" screening, ironically, I 
wandered into an East Village bookshop and picked up the nastiest
(and funniest) book ever written about the Beat Generation, 
"Crimes of the Beats," by the gang of lovably obnoxious
New York City poets and storytellers who call themselves 
"The Unbearables." 
They've been published in 
<A HREF="http://www.autonomedia.org/unbearab.htm">book form</A>
before, and I've also written about their activities
(such as their satirical protest against the 
<A HREF="../Topics/RingsideSeat.html">1995 NYU Beat Conference</A>)
earlier in these pages.  Their new book is a collection of 
essays, poems and memoirs mercilessly trashing the legendary
authors of the Beat Generation, as well as the hangers-on,
wannabes and innocent wide-eyed
believers they left in their wake.   The pieces take turns savaging 
Allen Ginsberg for his marketing savvy, Neal Cassady and Herbert 
Huncke for their weak
claims to mythical status, Gary Snyder (the 
"Buddhist budget advisor") for his placid personality,
and even, surprisingly, Gregory Corso (a 
saint of the modern-day Lower East Side literary underworld as far
as I can tell) for his blatant arrogance and nastiness.  But this
book is not a self-indulgent rant -- it's clever as hell, with each
pointed barb carefully sharpened to <I>hurt</I>.  The pieces are even 
short, a true rarity in these content-glutted days.<P>

This book should be on the bookshelf of every Beat reader, and it
can be ordered directly their publisher,
<A HREF="http://www.autonomedia.org/">Autonomedia</A>.  I have only 
one gripe, though: these Unbearables, whom I know to be mostly
a bunch of poverty-stricken, zonked-out, sloppily-dressed writers
who gather in the East Village to applaud each other at
poorly-attended poetry readings, claim not to be Beat themselves.  
Yeah, right, and Leonardo DiCaprio isn't a teen idol, and my 
Aunt Melinda isn't an alcoholic.  Sometimes the truth hurts.<P>

If Herbert Huncke and Jack Micheline represent the thesis of
Beat legend and hype, and if the Unbearables represent the antithesis,
who represents the inevitable synthesis?  I dunno, but I do like
the Louisville, Kentucky-based poet Ron Whitehead a lot.  His
writings are powerful (like those of the original Beats), but he's also
fresh and unpredictable and unpretentious (like the Unbearables).
I haven't yet seen his 
<A HREF="http://www.summersault.com/tilt-a-whirl/beaver_dam/">new book of poetry</A>, 
published by
<A HREF="http://www.summersault.com/tilt-a-whirl/">Tilt-A-Whirl Press</A>, 
but the guy who designed Tilt-A-Whirl's web page wrote me about it, and
I discovered that this guy had done some other excellent websites as
well, including one for the excellent small publisher 
<A HREF="http://www.softskull.com/">Soft Skull</A>.
He also had some fun
<A HREF="http://www.summersault.com/mark/">web pages of his own</A> 
(click on his hair).<P>

Yeah, the Beat fad is tired; I can't stand the hype myself anymore.
But somehow, if we get beyond that four letter word that once was useful but
isn't any longer ... still, hiding in corners out there, from the San
Francisco BART to the Chelsea Hotel, from Louisville, Kentucky 
to the Lower East Side and even out on the web itself, there is 
genius waiting to be found.   So I'm not giving up hope just yet.  
Though I'm close.<P>

<H3>April 11, 1998</H3>

1. Good news: 
<A HREF="../People/DianeDiPrima.html">Diane DiPrima</A>
is back in the spotlight!  She's kept a low profile for as long 
as I've known her name, and I've wondered if I'd ever have a chance
to hear her do a reading in person.  I still haven't caught her myself,
but I've heard glowing reports from a poetry reading in Camden, N.J.,
and I was sorry to hear that I missed an appearance at the St. Mark's
Church 
<A HREF="http://www.poetryproject.com/">Poetry Project</A> 
here in New York.  I hope she'll be back soon ...<P>

2. Why are literary mailing lists on the internet so conducive to
flame wars?  Not long ago a virulent flare-up on the PYNCHON-L, 
involving a few list members who'd personally known Thomas Pynchon 
fighting against each other and the rest of the list, was actually
collected and published as a book called 
'<A HREF="http://www.iam.com/lineland/">Lineland</A>'.
A couple of weeks ago, an epic flame war on the BEAT-L mailing list,
which I enjoyed being a part of for the past three years, caused
listowner Bill Gargan to finally throw up his hands in disgust and
close the list down for good.  You can read more about the whole mess
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/11381.html">here</A>.
I was very sorry to see this excellent (if sometimes ridiculous) list go
away, and I was happy when list survivors Diane Carter and Luke Kelly
(proprietor of the William S. Burroughs-oriented website 
<A HREF="http://www.bigtable.com/">Big Table</A>)
managed to create a new replacement list, SUBTERRANEANS, in 
record time.  If you're interested
in reading about or joining this list, here's a 
<A HREF="http://www.bigtable.com/subterraneans.html">FAQ</A>
that explains everything.  The good news is that flame wars
are banned on this list; the bad news is that in order to post
to it it is necessary to know how to spell "subterraneans".<P>

3. There's going to be a big memorial bash for Allen Ginsberg
on June 12 and 13, arranged by the irrepressible scene-maker/muck-raker
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/blackj.html">Al Aronowitz</A>.  
The first event is on June 12 at the Central Park Bandshell in New York City,
and is expected to feature Amiri Baraka, Richie Havens, David Amram, 
Anne Waldman, Rick Danko and Pete Seeger.  The second event is at the 
Performing Arts Center in Newark, New Jersey (where Ginsberg was born) on 
June 13.  This has been in the planning stages for a long time, and until 
recently nobody was sure if Aronowitz was actually going to pull the event 
off.  At this point it's starting to generate some real buzz, and may even 
turn out to be something special.  
<A HREF="http://www.con2.com/~marc/ginsberg/">Another Ginsberg memorial event</A> 
at the Cathedral of St. John The Divine in upper Manhattan on May 14  
should also be good, and is guaranteed to bring out only the Beat
faithful, since everybody else will be home watching the final
episode of 'Seinfeld'.<P>

<H3>March 4, 1998</H3>

1. Some new books are out.  I haven't read 
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0874778808/2652-5862122-077345">Beat Spirit: The Way of the Beat Writers As a Living Experience'</A>
by Mel Ash yet, but it looks appropriately unusual.  On the
more informational front, Steven Watson's 
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0679423710/2652-5862122-077345">Birth of the Beat Generation</A>' 
is probably the friendliest general history of the
Beat literary movement I've seen.  The author has also written
books about the Harlem Renaissance,
the Avant-Garde Arts movement etc., and he approaches the Beats
with refreshing curiousity and no pretensions, obsessions or 
axes to grind.  The book came out a couple of years
ago, but has just been rereleased in paperback with a 
new foreword by Robert Creeley.<P>

Moving out onto a limb, Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac and 
<A HREF="../People/CarolynCassady.html">Carolyn Cassady</A>
show up in bed together, or close to it, in 
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0062512951/2652-5862122-077345">Three In Love: Menages a Trois from Ancient to Modern Times</A>,'
a fascinating
new book about notable three-way sexual encounters in Western
history.  Other intellectual notables who show up in this book 
include Nietzsche, 
<A HREF="http://www.henrymiller.org/">Henry Miller</A>
and the 
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/acorn/germ/">Pre-Raphaelites</A>.
The three co-authors (a man and two women, hmm, I wonder ...) cover 
a lot of cultural territory in this book.<P>

Moving further out into the realm of the thoroughly subjective, 
I've been
corresponding via email with a Beat-inspired young poet from Singapore, 
Yong Shu Hoong.  He sent me a copy of his first book of poetry, titled
'<A HREF="http://www.singnet.com.sg/~shyong">Isaac</A>.'
The truth is, I have lots of email friends who send me samples
of their beat-inspired poetry, but too often when I read the 
poems they go in one ear and out the other -- the poems are 
probably excellent, I just don't understand them.  But I browsed
through 'Isaac' and it immediately clicked with me.  I love 
imagining the Singapore poetry reading that must have inspired this poignant
small poem, entitled: "THE BUTCHERING OF HOWL":<P>

<I><BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER> 
You must think that I was rude<BR>
but I have no disrespect for you,<BR>
knowing that you are a poet<BR>
more adept at toying with Chinese words.<BR>
But listening to you attempt a reading<BR>
of Allen Ginsberg's Howl<BR>
(and in thr process mispronounce<BR>
Arkansas) just weeks after his death,<BR>
I'm sorry I had to reach for the door.<BR>
I know you were doing it<BR>
out of the best intentions.<BR>
I know you were spurred on<BR>
by more than a little courage.<BR>
But I couldn't help feeling indignant<BR>
at the mutilation of<BR>
his words, his anger, his genius,<BR>
turning to leave before you could even<BR>
flip the first page.  Heavy-hearted,<BR>
I was never so sorry for any dead poet.<BR>
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE></I>
   
2. I pledged in these pages, after poet Denise Levertov died at the
end of last year, that there would be no more legendary Beat 
figures dying in 1998.  Well, it's only February and God has 
already called my bluff.
<A HREF="../People/JackMicheline.html">Jack Micheline</A>, 
highly authentic American street poet who stayed 
untamed to the end, died on a San Francisco BART (Bay Area
Rapid Transit) train on February 27.  Jo Grant of 
<A HREF="http://www.bookzen.com/">Bookzen.com</A>
has prepared a beautiful 
<A HREF="http://www.bookzen.com/o_micheline_p.html">tribute page</A>.<P>

3. Damn, I hate this sad stuff.  
<A HREF="../JCI/JCInterview.html">John Cassady</A>
sent me and a few other people a really touching note
on February 3rd, the 30th anniversary of the death of his
father 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal</A>.  It got  
me thinking.  
<A HREF="http://www.intrepidtrips.com/">Intrepid Trips</A>
(the really excellent new website by Ken Kesey, Ken Babbs
and the rest of the Merry Pranksters up in Oregon, who
also continue to run 
<A HREF="http://www.key-z.com/">Key-Z.com</A>) 
put 
<A HREF="http://www.intrepidtrips.com/cass.html">the letter</A>
up as part of their growing 
<A HREF="http://www.intrepidtrips.com/neal1.html">Neal pages</A>.<P>

4. I used to always say official websites sucked, plain and
simple.  I still believe this in theory, but you'll notice I
linked to two good official websites above (run by
<A HREF="http://www.intrepidtrips.com/">Ken Kesey</A>
and the 
<A HREF="http://www.henrymiller.org/">Henry Miller</A>
Library.)  I should mention one more: the really
carefully-put-together and innovative
<A HREF="http://www.bobdylan.com/">BobDylan.com</A>.
The most amazing thing about the site is probably the 
RealAudio recordings of rare live songs, not little snippets
of songs but full tracks previously available only 
on bootlegs.  This is good stuff.  My
friend Dan Levy designed this site, and I helped
with some technical parts myself, so I know
how hard Dan worked to make this "official site" not suck.
And it doesn't!<P>

<H3>February 2, 1998</H3>

1. "Vibrations", the 1971 autobiography of jazz musician and
ethnomusicologist
<A HREF="http://www.fmp.com/amram/">David Amram</A>
is about to be republished.  Amram was a close friend and
musical partner of 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>,
and I'm sure this book will be worth reading.       
The incredibly good-hearted and positive-minded Amram is 
also continuing to tour around the world taking part in 
various spontaneous retrospective beat happenings, along 
with a crowd of regulars that often  
includes poet Ron Whitehead, writer Doug Brinkley, 
biographer John Tytell, and on special occasions
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</A>,
Hunter S. Thompson, etc. 
Catch these guys if they come to your town, you won't regret it.<P>

2.  Speaking of Hunter S. Thompson, I wonder what's up with the 
movie version of his "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" which will 
supposedly star Johnny Depp as "Duke" himself?  If anybody 
has any gossip on this, please
<A HREF="mailto:brooklyn@litkicks.com">pass it along</A> ... 
No news, by the way,
on the long-awaited Francis Ford Coppola film
version of "On The Road".  At this point nobody thinks this movie
will ever get made.<P>

3. RALPH -- that is Ralph Alphonso, creator of the excellent
<A HREF="http://www.bongobeat.com/">RALPH</A>
zine -- doesn't have David Amram's impressive credentials, but
could also be described as a jazz musician 
and an ethnomusicologist (I love saying 'ethnomusicologist').  
Ralph appears to be a humble, probably lonely adult male hipster 
living somewhere in Canada who creates an appealingly weird, 
beat-toned, retro-styled zine 
all by himself, using an old Gestetner mimeograph machine.
He also tours with a band and creates music CD's 
of his poignant lounge songs, showing influences as diverse as Chet Baker,
Ray Davies (yeah!) and the Peanuts comic strip (one of the bands 
he works with is called the Van Pelt Trio).  I caught his live 
act in New York a while ago, and since then I've been a 
big RALPH fan.  
<A HREF="http://www.waterrowbooks.com/">Water Row Books</A>
must like him too, because they just published a book  
collection of the zine's first 25 issues.
They also sell his music CD's and other good stuff.<P>

4.  A personal note: I don't usually pay much 
attention to awards, but I have to admit I was pleased 
when Literary Kicks was nominated 
for a 1998 
<A HREF="http://www.webbyawards.com">Webby Award</A>.  
Maybe this is because I've always felt kind of snubbed 
by the "commercial" side of the web, which the Webby Awards 
(and it's sponsor, Web Magazine) represents.  Maybe I'm 
extra sensitive about the commercial vs. non-commercial
"thing" because I work for a mainstream online service during 
the day, and have many friends who are obsessively wrapped up
in various internet-related start-ups or business adventures.
These friends are usually the last to have a nice word to say
about Literary Kicks, because they just can't understand why I waste
my time building a site that doesn't do E-commerce or
sell ads.   And my graphic designer friends 
also treat my site with no respect, because I
don't use frames or tables or forms or navigation bars or GIF 
animations or VRML or Macromedia Flash or Javascript (just 
plain old 1994-style HTML, goddammit, it's good enough for me).<P>

And while I'm on this subject: it always pissed me off 
that I never got picked to be 
<A HREF="http://cool.infi.net">Cool Site of the Day</A>.  
Literary Kicks has been around a lot of days, over a 
thousand -- 
I think I was cool enough for 
<I>one of them</I>.  <P>

So the whole point of this aimless rant is ... thank you 
to the nice people at the Webby Awards who nominated me for 
for the Print/Zines award, and I'm looking forward
to the ceremony on March 6.<P>

Now watch, 
<A HREF="http://www.salonmag.com">Salon</A>
or
<A HREF="http://www.altculture.com">Alt.Culture</A>
will probably kick my ass.<P>
