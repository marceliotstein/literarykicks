Beat News Archive: 1996</H1>

<I>(Yes, this is a photo of Burroughs and Kerouac, apparently
posing as private detectives)</I><P>

<H3>December 13, 1996</H3>

1. 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
will be appearing on a 
<A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/">HotWired</A>
chat moderated by my cyber-buddy 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/digaland">Steve Silberman</A>
on Monday, Dec. 16 at 4 pm Pacific Time.
Check
<A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/poptalk/96/50/index4a.html">here</A>
for more info.
Warning: you MUST have RealAudio installed for HotWired 
chats.  Also, if you miss the chat on Monday, you can listen
to the RealAudio file later.<P>

2. Several new 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac</A> 
books are out.  "Angelheaded Hipster" by Steve 
Turner includes many never-before-seen photos.  
Ken McGoogan's "Kerouac's Ghost" is a fictional
treatment of Jack's life, literally narrated by
Jack's ghost.  I haven't seen this one yet, but I've
heard about it and it sounds interestingly odd.  There's
a fairly scholarly treatment of Jack's fiction by Tim
Hunt called "Kerouac's Crooked Road."  Finally, 
Mind In Motion, which made the Kerouac ROMnibus CD-Rom 
that came out about a year ago, is now selling the 
CD-Rom directly via the web, and has created a good new 
<A HREF="http://www.mindinmotion.com/kerouac/">website</A>
featuring extensive samples from it.  Could be a cool
Christmas present for someone.<P>

How long will the Beat-book glut continue?  I don't know,
but I hope we'll continue to see original and ground-breaking
treatments, like the "Women of the Beat Generation" book I 
mentioned several weeks ago (see below), and fewer rehashes
of the basic facts.  I'm quite certain the "commercialization
of Beatness" is now at an all-time high.  Oh well ... when
the fad passes, I'll still be here.<P>

3. Life's been crazy this month.   Which is nothing new.  
I'm working on a couple of web-fiction-related projects
that will hopefully be coming out in the first half of 
'97 -- one of them a book, and one a CD-Rom.  To 
the many people who've sent me email that I've taken a 
ridiculously long time to write back to -- sorry I'm so
slow, but please don't stop writing.  I love getting 
interesting mails ... I just have trouble sometimes
clearing my brain of other stuff enough to compose
intelligent replies.  And I don't want to just write back
with "Thanks for your kind words" like I hear other
webmasters sometimes do.  So bear with me please ...
and if I seem to have lost your mail entirely (this 
*almost* never happens) please do give me another chance.<P>

<H3>November 7, 1996</H3>

1. Whoa!  I just heard 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>
will be reading at the Barnes & Noble in Union Square 
(17th St. around Park Avenue)
here in New York City Friday November 8 at 7:30.  I'm
really psyched, as I've never seen him read before.
To other New Yorkers out there: this is not likely to be 
often repeated, so don't miss the chance.<P>

2. This is nowhere near as cool as the above announcement,
but I've got more details about the Web Writers reading
I'll be participating in on November 16th.  It's called
POISON: WRITERS ON THE WEB and it's at 3:30 pm at the
Hudson Park Branch of the New York Public Library (66
Leroy Street, between 7th Ave. and Hudson).  This 
<I>is</I> likely to be often repeated, but I hope some
of you can come anyway.<P>

<H3>November 4, 1996</H3>

The news organizations have been hounding me, because
everybody is dying to find out who Literary Kicks 
will endorse in the Presidential election.  Well, the
suspense is about to end. <P>

First, let me say that there is no clear Beat choice
here.  I know 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
supports Ralph Nader, predicatably, and Nader does seem
to be the only candidate without an ego the size of the 
Goodyear blimp.  But nobody even knows he's running -- and
if I'm going to support a candidate who nobody's heard
of I'd probably go with net personality
<A HREF="http://www.onworld.com/MUT/der96/">R. U. Sirius</A>, 
who has a better website.<P>

But let's talk about Bob Dole.  Dole is from Kansas, 
and being from Kansas gives you instant authenticity in the
Beat universe.  Remember Kerouac's first trip across America in 
"<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>"?
He wished he was from Kansas, and damn, I wish I was 
from Kansas too!<P>

But let's face facts: Bob Dole is a friggin' bore.
That's all there is to it.  And I can't stand it that 
he's pulling all this "character" bullshit against
Clinton so late in the campaign and pretending it's 
not a desperation move.  You know, I actually like 
it that Bill Clinton is a regular guy, that he makes 
mistakes and smokes weed and gets himself into
trouble every now and then.  He's just trying to have
some fun, and if a President of the United States
can't have some fun, then what the hell is it all about anyway?
Say Kerouac and Cassady had run into Bob Dole in their
travels across America in the 40's -- I bet they would
have run just as fast in the other direction.  Maybe
they would have even headed straight back for the East 
Coast right then and there, and maybe "On The Road" would
have never even been written!<P>

Bob Dole is just not a Beat guy.  Literary Kicks endorses 
Bill Clinton for President of the United States of America.<P>

<H3>October 21, 1996</H3>

1. There are a ton of new Beat-related books and other
publications out there.  I mean a TON.  I always try to 
keep my "Beat News" entries short and sweet, but what am I 
to do?  Here's a few highlights:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Women of the Beat Generation</STRONG> by
Brenda Knight (Conari Press): an excellent, thorough anthology of 
stories, poems, autobiographical fragments and biographical
pieces representing the 
often-forgotten women who participated in the Beat
movement.  Included are 
<A HREF="../People/AnneWaldman.html">Anne Waldman</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/CarolynCassady.html">Carolyn Cassady</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/JanKerouac.html">Jan Kerouac</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/JoanVollmerAdams.html">Joan Vollmer Adams</A>, 
Diane DiPrima (I need a page on her!), Jay DiFeo and many lesser 
known but interesting writers, artists and creative people.
</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Mountains and Rivers Without End</STRONG> by 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>
(Counterpoint):
This work seems to have some kind of epic importance to
Snyder, and he's apparently been working on it for many years.  
I also heard from a few friends in California that he actually did
a reading in public to celebrate the publication.  Gary, will
you ever come to New York and read here?  I know there are
no redwood trees or berry bushes or waterfalls.  But we have
great falafel and good record stores.</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Ballad of the Skeletons</STRONG> by
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>:
Saw the video of this song on MTV last night.  The music
is pretty strong, not surprisingly as it features Paul 
McCartney, Philip Glass and the great Lenny 
Kaye on various guitars and keyboards.
Lyrically I don't think this is Ginsberg's most sublime moment;
it's more like a rant than like a poem, and goes in for a lot
of simple jokey rhymes.  It's okay, though.  The video, directed by 
Gus Van Sant, is quite interesting.  It features Ginsberg's skull-like 
face reciting in close-up as black-and-white images reflect the
meanings.  Other new Ginsberg stuff out there: a book of unusual
color illustrations accompanying selected poems, by artist
Eric Drooker ("Illuminated Poems," published by Four Walls
Eight Windows) and a new entry in Allen's journal series, "Indian
Journals."</LI>

<LI><STRONG>Beat Generation: Glory Days In Greenwich Village</STRONG> by
Fred McDarrah and Gloria McDarrah (Schirmer Books): this is a
fascinating book of photographs accompanied by text.  Lots of
shots I'd never seen before.  Another photography book is 
<STRONG>Angels Anarchists and Gods</STRONG> by Christopher Felver
(Louisiana State University) including portraits of almost 
all the surviving Beats, taken in the
80's and 90's, as well as many of their cultural allies in art,
publishing and street politics.</LI>
</UL>

2. Here's 
<A HREF="Lowell96Report.html">Phil Chaput's report</A> 
on the Lowell Kerouac celebration a few weeks ago, originally
posted to the BEAT-L mailing list (for info on joining this
list, which has been very active and enjoyable lately, see
my 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A> 
page).<P>

3. I was recently invited to a showcase reading at the 
Nuyorican Poets Cafe of a screenplay based on
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs'</A>
autobiographical novel "Queer."  The screenplay was written by David Ohle, 
and it skillfully showed a human side of the prickly William S. 
Burroughs that we don't often get to see -- Burroughs as a lonely,
confused man, using his twisted sense of humor to attract people
only, perhaps, because he had no better lure.
I think this would make an excellent movie, probably a far more 
down-to-earth one than David Cronenberg's expressionistic
"<A HREF="../Films/NakedLunchFilm.html">Naked Lunch</A>",
and if you're a filmmaker who wants to make it, please write to
<A HREF="mailto:davo@cjnetworks.com">the author</A>.<P>

4. New in Literary Kicks: a page on poet
<A HREF="../People/DALevy.html">D.A. Levy</A>, 
contributed by 
<A HREF="../HomePages/LutherJett.html">W. Luther Jett</A>.<P>

5. I'll be part of a web-fiction reading on Saturday, 
November 16th, 3:30-4:30 PM, at the Hudson Park Branch of
the New York Public Library (in the West Village).
This is being arranged by David Alexander, and among
the other readers will be my wife Meg, who is about
to announce a great new webzine all her own -- here's a 
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto">sneak preview</A>.
And I hope some of you can make it to the reading! <P>

<H3>October 1, 1996</H3>

1. Jesse Crumb, the son of the superb underground cartoonist
Robert Crumb, has illustrated a pack of Beat trading cards,
published by Kitchen Sink Press and 
available at good bookstores or comic book shops.
The cards depict Beat writers, jazz
musicians and other personalities, including some unexpected
choices like Babs Gonzales, Miles Davis, Tuli Kupferberg and
Mort Sahl.  Interestingly, Jack 
Kerouac is not present but only alluded to, as if to 
proclaim his holy status.  The drawings are in the
classic Crumb style, and are quite beautiful.<P> 

2. There are a LOT of beat festivals and happenings going on.  
Let's see ... the University of Kansas is hosting "A Festival: 
William S. Burroughs and the Arts" from late October through Jan 1 1997.  
There will be some interesting guests; here's the
<A HREF="http://www.urc.ukans.edu/News/96N/SepNews/Sep18/burroughs.html">press release</A>.
The University of Texas at Austin is running a show called
"Beat: The Hip Highways and Bebop Byways of Modern American Letters."
A San Francisco/SOMA month-long festival called Re/BEAT looks like
a lot of fun -- here's their 
<A HREF="http://www.slip.net/~gamuse/calend.html">calendar</A>.
The Whitney Museum exhibit "Beat Culture and the New America" is also
coming to San Francisco on October 5th.  It will be at the 
<A HREF="http://www.thinker.org/deyoung/exhibitions/beat/">M. H. DeYoung</A>
Memorial Museum through December 29.  Allen Ginsberg is doing 
October readings around the country, including San Francisco and New York.
Finally, don't forget the annual 
<A HREF="../News/Lowell96.html">Kerouac festival</A>
in Lowell, Massachusetts.  Featured guests include 
Ed Sanders and musician Rob Buck, formerly of 10000 Maniacs.<P>

3. Going out on a limb here: 90's writer Douglas Coupland is
<I>not</I> a beat writer by any means.  And I know about the
gag impulse naturally caused by writers who try too hard to
"capture a generation" (yuck).  Still, I read Coupland's "Microserfs"
and I liked it.  I don't care whether it captures deep generational
truths or not -- it's an enjoyable and poignant story, and
the author does have some clue what the life of a software developer
is like (believe me, I know).  Anyway, the reason I mention all this
is that Coupland now has
<A HREF="http://www.coupland.com">his own website</A>.
It's worth a look.<P>

Another somewhat Coupland-esque new site
is Carl Steadman's enigmatic
<A HREF="http://www.placing.com">Placing</A>,
which looks affectionately at the packaged products that 
define our personal lives more than we often think. 
I hope Carl doesn't get mad at me for calling him 
Coupland-esque.<P>

4. I heard there'll be a Kerouac tribute album coming out soon,
with a lot of excellent participants including Patti Smith,
Lou Reed, Sonic Youth.  This is all on the level of rumour
right now -- can anyone tell me more?<P>

<H3>September 5, 1996</H3>

I hate it when the summer ends.<P>

1. Have you ever seen the famous 1965 photo of the crowd of Beat
writers outside the
<A HREF="../Places/CityLights.html">City Lights</A> 
bookstore?  The photo was taken by Larry Keenan 
(<A HREF="../Images/keenan1.jpg">here he is</A>, 
with the photo, and his wife Lisa), and I was
pleased to receive email from the photographer himself 
a few months ago.  He actually wrote to me to ask me to please
stop using his photos without permission, but instead of 
being nasty about it (as I've heard other copyright-holders
sometimes are), he simply asked me to credit him whenever I used one
of his pictures, which I was happy to do.  We then corresponded
a few times, and when I asked him to tell me the story behind his
most famous photo he told me this:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
To answer your question briefly, Yes I did know what I was doing was
important.  In fact, this is what I was telling my parents when they did not
want me going over to the city to photograph "those dirty beatniks".
I had the good fortune to meet Michael McClure at Calif. College of Arts and
Crafts where he was/is teaching and I was a student.  My friend Dale Smith 
and I approached McClure about helping us with a project we were doing.
During the course of our meeting he said "would you guys like to photograph
some of my friends"?  We asked "who are your friends"?  Allen Ginsberg, Ken
Kesey, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, etc.  We were blown-away.
So for the next year or so we went over to his house most Saturdays and hung
out for an hour or so and then went over to a Beat's house or apartment and
spent the day photographing him or them.  It was always a good experience.
They were very nice to us.  We were nice too, we gave them mounted prints.
Pretty soon we were being invited to parties that we were told not to bring
any cameras to. <P>

To make a long story short.  My parents made me mow the lawn before I could
go over to SF and shoot the Last Gathering photo and the McClure,
Dylan, Ginsberg photo.<P>

</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

Mowing the lawn ... pretty classic.  Anyway, there's a longer interview
with Larry Keenan up at 
<A HREF="http://www.bitweaver.com">The BitWeaver's Loom</A>,
an art-oriented site he's involved with.  It shows
some of Keenan's newer computer-generated artwork as well as a few
Beat photographs.  Well worth checking out.  A book of Keenan's
photos will also be out soon, and several will be on display in New
York City at Great Modern Pictures, 48 E. 82nd Street from Sept. 12
through Nov. 30.<P>

2. Once again, the folks in Jack Kerouac's hometown of 
<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A>,
Massachusetts are putting on a big Kerouac festival in October.
Here's 
<A HREF="../News/Lowell96.html">what's going on</A> there.
An appearance by 
<A HREF="../People/EdSanders.html">Ed Sanders</A> 
will be one of this year's highlights.  <P>

3. Allen Ginsberg News: Here's a page about the new
<A HREF="http://www.panix.com/~esharp/">State Of The Union</A>
double CD, produced by Elliot Sharp.  It features a 
piece by Ginsberg, along with 145 (!) other pieces.  Profits go to
the National Coalition Against Censorship, which sounds like a 
pretty good cause to me.  Also, there's an interview with Ginsberg 
<A HREF="http://gloria-brame.com/index.htm">here</A>.  
Finally, the word is out that Ginsberg has recorded a version
of his "Ballad Of The Skeletons" with a pretty impressive group
of musicians: Paul McCartney, Lenny Kaye, Philip Glass and Marc
Ribot.  Should be interesting!<P>

4. The new 
<A HREF="http://ezone.org/ez/">Enterzone</A> is out, and after
a nine-month hiatus I'm in it again!  It's nice to be back.  Still
my favorite zine.<P>

<h3>August 12, 1996</H3>

1. I've mentioned 
"<A HREF="http://www.ucs.usl.edu/~tbf4931/Wisdom/wisdom1.html">Wisdom's Maw</A>"
before.  It's a novel (and a website) by Todd Brendan Fahey about the
same real-life characters Tom Wolfe wrote about in the "Electric Kool-Aid 
Acid Test."   That book was a work of journalism, but Fahey's book 
is simply fiction, and this frees him to take us on several
interesting tangents.  We meet Ken Kesey (here called Franklin Moore)
as a young would-be novelist discovering LSD while causing trouble
among the snooty writers at Stanford's creative writing program, and
we drop in on Big Sur with a sadly out-of-touch Jack Kerouac (who
appears under his own name).  Much of the book has to do with the
mysteries of CIA involvement in early LSD experiments.  There may be
substance to some of Fahey's ideas about this, but in any case the
book wouldn't be worth anything if it weren't an enjoyable reading
experience.  It is!  If you liked "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test," 
<A HREF="http://www2.linknet.net/fahey/Wisdom/">check this one out</A>.<P>

2. I saw a really wonderful show last week.  Ralph Alphonso,
longtime publisher of the beat poetry rag <I>RALPH</I>, 
did what I've always wanted to do: gathered together a few
high-spirited pop/folk/jazz musicians and went on tour.  They
arrived in New York to play CBGB's Gallery last week (parenthetically,
check out the new 
<A HREF="http://www.cbgb.com">CBGB's website</A> if you're interested in
this legendary punk club), and put on a superb show.  Ralph's style
is kitschy on the outside but sincere within, and this is the
way I like it (as opposed to the reverse: sincere on the outside
but kitschy within, like, say, Sting's solo albums).   I think
the tour is already nearing an end, but please visit 
<A HREF="http://www.bongobeat.com">Ralph's website</A>, 
where you can hear samples of his music, order his CD's or 
subscribe to his one-man zine.<P>

3. A huge poetry/beat renaissance/spoken word festival in New 
Orleans starts this week.  Here's the latest
<A HREF="../News/Insomniacathon.html">schedule</A>. <P>

<H3>August 8, 1996</H3>

1. I just heard that 
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke</A> died this morning.  
Huncke was a close friend of William S. Burroughs,
Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg during the days of their early adventures
together in New York City.  He was their prototypical Times Square 
junkie/hustler connection, the "real thing" that they (especially Burroughs) 
often tried to emulate.  He appeared in 
"<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>" 
as the character named Elmer Hassel (Sal and Dean are always wondering "Where's 
Elmer Hassel"), and in 
"<A HREF="../Books/Junky.html">Junky</A>" 
as the experienced drug-user Herman.  According to Kerouac,
who first used the term 
"<A HREF="../Topics/BeatEtymology.html">beat</A>" 
to describe his literary generation, it was
Huncke who first introduced him to the word.<P>
 
Like almost all friends of Ginsberg, Kerouac and Burroughs, Huncke became
a published writer after the beat phemonenon occurred.  His story "Elsie
John," reprinted in Ann Charters collection "The Beat Reader," is a raw,
honest and fascinating piece.  He also wrote a full-length autobiography 
called "Guilty of Everything," as well as a shorter 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/hanuman/">Hanuman</A>
book with the same title.<P>
 
He lived out his last years in the Chelsea Hotel in New York City.  He
was taken to Beth Israel Hospital a few days ago, and that's where he
died this morning at 7:15.<P>

<H3>July 23, 1996</H3>

1. The Poetry Project has been a positive force
in the New York/downtown lit scene for as long as I can remember.
The Project runs readings at St. Mark's Church in the Bowery,
a beautiful old church that dates back to the days when the
East Village was mostly farmland.  If you're visiting New York,
I'd recommend trying to catch one of these events.  How will
you know the schedule, you ask?  Just check the new
<A HREF="http://www.poetryproject.com">Poetry Project website</A>!<P>

2. The 
<A HREF="http://www.sonic.net/~goblin">Goblin</A> webzine 
has a lot of interesting beat-related material, like an
interview with Ed Sanders and, in the latest issue, a Neal
Cassady reminiscence by Charles Plymell.  I also like
the current cover story about the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers,
my fave underground comix when I was a kid.<P>

3. Here's a reprint of an 
<A HREF="../Topics/WhiteheadOnBurroughs.html">interview with Williams S. Burroughs</A>
conducted by Ron Whitehead, whose poem "Calling All Toads" also concludes the
piece.  One of the things they discuss is a huge New Orleans poetry fest Ron 
is putting together in August.  Should be a blast -- I'd go if I had the
money (dammit).  See below for more info on this.<P>

4. Thought I'd point you to a new site I like a lot.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.sos.net/home/jef/posi-web/index.html">Posi-Web</A>
is a constantly changing series of simple, quickly generated personal 
pages by a growing list of web people.  Lots of interesting pictures
and thoughts.  Just for fun.  There's no one starting point (each
contributor maintains his or her own pages) but the above link goes 
to Jef'n'Gael's page -- they started this whole thing.<P>

5. Also ... check out this 
<A HREF="http://www.thehomepage.com/coldwell/ginsberg/default.htm">nightmare image</A>
from some strange alternate universe where real estate and poetry are reversed.  What 
a bad trip!  (Thanks to
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/digaland">Steve</A> 
for finding me this).<P>

Hey!  Literary Kicks is two years old today.<P>

<H3>June 27, 1996</H3>

1. 
<A HREF="http://www.bitstream.net/london/">The Spoken Word Network</A> 
is an interesting web space devoted to poets, storytellers and
performance artists.  Their newsletter, 
<A HREF="http://www.bitstream.net/london/shout.html">Shout!</A>, 
is running an original interview with Allen Ginsberg.   
Worth checking out.<P>

2. The LOWELL CELEBRATES KEROUAC gang 
(<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A> 
was Kerouac's hometown)
is soliciting entries for the annual Jack Kerouac Literary Prize.
They will accept typed, double-spaced manuscripts containing stories 
(no more than 3) up to 30 pages, or 
poems (no more than 8) up to fifteen pages.  Entries must be 
received by August 1, must be accompanied by a 3x5 index card
containing the author's name, address, telephone number and 
manuscript title (the author's name may not appear on    
the manuscript), and must also be accompanied by $5 checks
made out to LOWELL CELEBRATES KEROUAC.  Submit all manuscripts
to The Jack Kerouac Literary Prize, P.O. Box 8788, Lowell, 
MA 01853-8788, or write to this address for further details.
The winner will be part of the annual Kerouac celebration that
takes place this year on October 3-6.<P>

3. Wisdom's Maw, Todd Brendan Fahey's novel about some semi-imagined 
strange activities involving the CIA, LSD experiments and several 
well-known Beat figures in the 1960's, has been available in a 
<A HREF="http://www.ucs.usl.edu/~tbf4931/Wisdom/wisdom1.html">web version</A>
for some time now.  Fahey recently found a publisher for the book --
get the details 
<A HREF="http://www2.linknet.net/fahey/Wisdom/">here</A>.<P>

4. Wow, there are so many things I have to announce!  Here's another:
Ron Whitehead, who runs a publishing/happenings organization called 
RANT For The Literary Renaissance, is producing an event in New Orleans
on August 16-18.  The RANT eats New Orleans 48-Hour Non-Stop Music & 
Poetry INSOMNIACATHON at The Howlin Wolf Club will feature
Douglas Brinkley & The Majic Bus, 
Diane di Prima, 
David Amram, 
<A HREF="../People/EdSanders.html">Ed Sanders</A>, 
Hunter S. Thompson, 
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</A>
and others.<P>

5. There's a very insightful article about 
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>
in the June 6 issue of the London Review of Books.  It's
written by Iain Sinclair, and the first sentence is: "There may
be only two writers, currently at work in America, who can bring
themselves, unblushing, to use the phrase 'drinky poo'" (The other,
if you were wondering, is Carl Hiaasen).
If, like most of us, you do not live in London: check your library,
they probably have a copy.<P>

6. One new thing in LitKicks this month: Andrew Burnett's passionate
and well-researched exploration of 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>'s
historic Denver.  It's put together in the form of a "Beat Baedeker"
including three separate guided tours, and if you're interested in 
Neal Cassady you'll definitely discover interesting things 
here, in 
<A HREF="../Denver/index.html">Neal's Denver</A>.<P>

While we're on the subject of Neal, I should mention Tom Christopher's
exhaustive new publication, "Neal Cassady."  This is the first of what
will be several volumes documenting Neal's mysterious life in 
groundbreaking detail.  This first publication is about Neal's early
days and includes many reproductions of school documents and city
records.  It's looks more like a zine than a book, and can be found
in most Beat-conscious bookstores (like, for instance, City Lights
in San Francisco or Water Row in Massachusetts)<P>

7. 
<A HREF="http://ezone.org:1080/ez/">Enterzone</A>, now in its second year as
a great non-profit webzine for experimental/underground art and fiction, has
moved to a new URL (see link above).  You can also now enter the Zone at a 
different level by going to the base URL
<A HREF="http://ezone.org:1080/">http://ezone.org:1080/</A>, 
where you see the wider, universe that surrounds this zine.<P>

Enterzone was favorably reviewed in The New Yorker last week, in 
their Summer Fiction Issue (June 24/July 1, p. 26), and a piece
I contributed to Enterzone with a friend was also mentioned in the 
review.  Kind of cool that us indie web writers and artists are
finally being noticed by the world out there.  Still, though, to
paraphrase Kurt Cobain -- snooty literary magazines still suck!
(Okay, I feel better now that I've said that.)<P>

<H3>June 7, 1996</H3>

<A HREF="../People/JanKerouac.html">Jan Kerouac</A>,  
the only child of her father 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack</A>,  
has died at the age of 44.  She had been very ill with kidney
disease for a long time, and was in an Albuquerque hospital 
recovering from an operation on her spleen when she died.<P>

Jan lived a difficult life.  She rarely met her father, 
who spent most of his life denying that she was his.  A
promising career as a writer (her first book, "Baby Driver,"
was liked by many people) was derailed by her illness,
personal problems and an ugly, obsessive public feud with the 
holders of the Kerouac estate, which seemed to be consuming
her entirely in her final years.<P>

I never met or spoke to Jan, but through an intermediary I
was given the opportunity to publish an excerpt from her
novel in progress, "Parrot Fever," which deals with the death
of her mother, among other things.  Jan's friend Gerald 
Nicosia  (a Kerouac biographer) is going to try to arrange
for posthumous publication of this book, which would be her
third.    The excerpt is 
<A HREF="../IKL/Parrot.html">here</A>.  <P>

<H3>June 3, 1996</H3>

1. Happy 70th birthday 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>!<P>

2. Allen is probably bummed, though, about Timothy Leary's death
this past weekend.  An interesting piece of info here: one of 
Leary's last phone calls, a few hours before he died, was to William 
S. Burroughs.  Leary told Burroughs: "I hope someday
I'll be as funny as you are."<P>

3. This is way overdue: I'm going to spend the next few months 
reviewing and updating all the pages in LitKicks.  Some of the
info is out of date, and some areas need work -- hopefully things
will start shaping up real soon.  I'm keeping the basic design the
same, though (I think).  I never liked the look of frames, and 
even though I <I>do</I> know Java and Shockwave, I just don't see
that stuff fitting in here.  If anyone has thoughts on this, though, 
send them along.<P>

4. Coming soon: a pretty impressive photo-essay/walking-tour of
Neal Cassady's Denver, contributed by Andrew Burnett.<P>

<H3>May 7, 1996</H3>

1. Francis Ford Coppola, according to recent reports, still
has vague plans to direct a film version of 
"<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>."
He'd better hurry, though -- others are moving in on
his territory.  A movie about an incident in the life of 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>,
for instance, is now in the works.  It's based on a letter
Neal wrote to 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
about some sexual escapades involving a girl named Joan
Anderson, and it might be called "The Last Time I Committed
Suicide" (a phrase found on the well-known recording of Neal 
onstage at a Grateful Dead show in the 60's).  A guy named 
Stephen Kay is the writer/director, and Keanu Reeves, a 
friend of Stephen's, will play a friend of Neal's.  Neal
will be played by an actor named Thomas Jane.  The filmmakers
have also enlisted the help of 
<A HREF="../People/CarolynCassady.html">Carolyn Cassady</A>
-- and I'd like to thank Carolyn for giving me this scoop!<P>

2. I insist that Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter is a 
beatnik in the truest and best sense of the word.  Not just because
Neal Cassady rapped onstage with the Dead (see above) but also
because of the deep and raw <I>beatness</I> of the characters in
many of Hunter's songs, from "Brown Eyed Woman" to "Jack Straw" to
"Wharf Rat" to "Dire Wolf" to "Mississippi Half Step Uptown 
Toodeloo" and "Cumberland Blues."  I bet Kerouac
would have even liked "Workingman's Dead" (he died about two years 
too soon, so we'll never know).  Anyway, the reason I mention this
is that Robert Hunter is now on the web!  His site is huge and
highly personal, and he's doing all the techie work himself (using
PageMill, I understand).  A novel in progress, "Giant's Harp,"
is part of the site, along with journal entries, lyrics, e-mail
and lots of other stuff.  
<A HREF="http://grateful.dead.net/RobertHunterArchive.html/hunterarchive.html">Check
this place out!</A><P>

<H3>April 16, 1996</H3>

1. A couple of friends (Christian Crumlish and Briggs Nisbet, editors
of 
<A HREF="http://ezone.org/ez">Enterzone</A>)
went to the San Francisco poetry reading I mentioned below, featuring 
Gary Snyder, Michael McClure and others, and also attended a similar
indoor reading the next day.  They wrote a pretty cool 
<A HREF="http://ezone.org:1080/un/news/watershed.html">report</A>
on these events; check it out.<P>

2. I recently heard from a friend of the important counter-culture
journalist Al Aronowitz, who was a part of the Beat/hippie scene 
that flourished decades ago.  Aronowitz has suffered health problems recently, 
but he's also put together his own web site, including several 
Beat-related articles:
<A HREF="http://www.bigmagic.com/pages/blackj/">here it is</A>.<P>

3. If you haven't seen 
<A HREF="http://www.leary.com/">Timothy Leary's website</A>
yet, it's worth a look.  Though Leary is not generally thought
of as part of the Beat world, it was 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>'s
enthusiastic endorsement of Leary and his ideas about LSD that
set him on the path to fame in the early 60's.  Leary
is now seriously ill with cancer, and has set out to explore the fact
of his impending death in an optimistic and highly public way.  I
have mixed feelings about many of the things Leary has done and said
in his life, but his approach towards death is proving to be one of 
his more authentic moments.<P>

<H3>April 5, 1996</H3>

1. I found
<A HREF="../People/AnneWaldman.html">Anne Waldman</A>'s
new collection of Beat writings, "The Beat Book," 
in a bookstore recently.  It covers many of the same writers
as the other well-known Beat anthology (Ann Charters' "Beat Reader")
but with less expository material and a few writers (Joanne
Kyger, for instance) who were not included in the Charters book.
Seems like an excellent introductory volume.<P>

2. I'm happily noticing that 
<A HREF="../People/BobKaufman.html">Bob Kaufman</A>
is getting more attention lately.  I get a significant amount
of e-mail about this enigmatic and complicated jazz poet, and 
there's also going to be a special evening of readings dedicated
to his works at St. Mark's Church in New York on April 17.  Readers
will include Cecil Taylor, Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis and 
<A HREF="../People/TedJoans.html">Ted Joans</A>.<P>

Meanwhile on the West Coast: 
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A>
and
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>
are appearing tomorrow at a reading in Golden Gate Park in
San Francisco.  Sorry for the late notice ... I also don't
know much about this event.  It's good to know that Gary Snyder
is making appearances though. I hope he'll show up sometime
in New York.<P>

3. Remember a few weeks ago in this space when I complained that 
nobody would buy the Voyager/Red Hot "Beat Experience" CD-Rom for
forty dollars?  Well, I just found out the price has been reduced
to a MUCH more reasonable $25.99.  YES!  I wonder ... did I have
anything to do with this?<P>

4. Speaking of egotistical notions ... the 
<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times Website</A>
wrote an incredibly nice article about me and my own web works,
particularly my
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn/">Queensboro Ballads</A>
project.  I sent copies to all my relatives -- many of whom
still don't understand what the Web is, but if the New York Times
likes me, even my family may have to give in.  Anyway, the
article is
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/hype/nyt032596/">here</A>.  Also, I 
"remastered" some of the larger graphics files on Queensboro
Ballads for better quality and smaller size (I finally have a 
copy of Photoshop, as you may have already noticed), so if
you got frustrated with it in the past due to large download
times, please give it another try.<P>

5. Here's a bizarre find:
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>
appears on a new X-Files soundtrack album, reciting "Star Me Kitten"
as REM plays in the background.  I want to believe.<P>

<H3>March 15, 1996</H3>

Wow, I've been away a while.  Still recovering from the ordeal of 
organizing a fiction/poetry reading last month -- it went *great*, by the way,
and we're already thinking of doing it again.  Here's a 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn/Events/biblios.html">bunch of pictures</A>
from the event.  (I even centered my text on this page, 
<A HREF="http://www.suck.com/">suck.com</A> 
style, just because I've been in a wacky mood and it looks kinda cool.)<P>

Lots of good new Beat stuff out there.  Let's see ... <P>

1. I recently stumbled across the new 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> book, 
"Ghost of Chance" -- I don't know if it's any good, but it has a beautiful
cover design.  A very WIRED look, in fact.  It goes well with Burroughs style. <P>

2. Red Hot Organization, which did the Beat Generation CD-ROM I
wrote about below, also just released a tribute album, OffBeat, containing contributions
from musicians like David Byrne and DJ Spooky.  Red Hot Organization is a good
cause (against AIDS) so if you're thinking of buying this CD: ahh, just go do it.<P>

3. Still no news on the proposed 
"<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>" 
movie.  I recently found and read a bootleg copy of the screenplay, though.
It could have been worse -- they stuck pretty close 
to the story, except they put the Mexican Girl scene at the end of the second
trip instead of the first.  WHAT ARE THEY -- INSANE????  You can't mess with this
stuff.  It's sacred.  But the screenplay was fairly true to the book.  Dean is
by far the most prominent character in this treatment, and some aspects of the 
book seem to take a back-seat (so to speak) to the Dean Moriarty story.  But 
that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Anyway, there's still no word that the 
movie will ever be made at all.<P>

4. I'm sick of reading articles about the dumb fights between 
<A HREF="../People/JanKerouac.html">Jan Kerouac</A> 
and the Sampas family over the 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac</A> estate.  Apparently Jan wanted
to have his grave moved to New Hampshire from 
<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A>. 
A lot of people have written asking why I don't cover these issues in Literary 
Kicks -- I don't because I think legal battles are depressing and boring.
I still think Jan Kerouac is a good writer.<P>

5. New stuff here, mostly from contributors: a couple of 
personal memoirs (on
<A HREF="../Topics/StedmanOnMontgomery.html">John Montgomery</A>
and
<A HREF="../Topics/HannaOnGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>),
a 
<A HREF="../People/JackMicheline.html">Jack Micheline</A>
page, and some additions to my already ridiculously lengthy
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatsInRock.html">Beats in Rock Music</A>)
page.  Coming soon: stuff on Ed Sanders, the Fugs, Harry Smith.<P>

I'll try not to stay away so long next time.  <P>

<H3>February 7, 1996</H3>

1. If anybody can make it to downtown New York on February 14 (Valentine's 
Day),
my wife
and I are arranging a fiction/poetry reading featuring writers who write 
on the Web.  It's at Biblio's, a bookstore/cafe at 317 Church St. (just south

Please come!  It's free, Biblio's has good coffee, and it should all
be a lot of fun.<P>
 
2. Here are two brief excursions into the meaning of Allen Ginsberg in the
universe.  One is a fairly angry 
<A HREF="http://www.uidaho.edu/~hatch923/hoot.html">parody of 'Howl'</A>
written by 
<A HREF="http://www.uidaho.edu/~hatch923">Karney Hatch</A>
that expresses how many people (myself included, sometimes) feel when
Beat poets try too hard to succeed in the world of mainstream literary
academia and commercial publishing.  The other link is a small positive 
note, a few 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/digaland/ag.uncond.mind.html">wise words by Ginsberg</A>
that are a part of
Deadhead-chronicler-extraordinaire (and HotWired editor)
Steve Silberman's 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/digaland">Digaland</A>
web page.<P>
 
3. 
<A HREF="http://www.voyagerco.com">Voyager</A> is releasing a 
new CD-Rom, "The Beat Experience."
Unlike the informative, no-nonsense recent Kerouac CD-Rom (which I 
wrote about below), this is a totally experimental freeform production.
It's laid out in the form of a "Beat Pad" where everything is clickable.
The best news is that one
of the contributing artists is Gary Panter, who was responsible for
the excellent visuals on the horribly unappreciated "Pee Wee Herman
Show" several years back.  Yes, a direct connection now exists between
Pee Wee Herman and the Beats -- I'd always felt there had to be one.<P>

The project will benefit the Red Hot Organization, which has
previously made several good compilation CD's (like NO ALTERNATIVE)
to fund their AIDS relief work.  However, I doubt they'll earn as much
from this CD-ROM, since it sticks to the archaic practice of charging an
unrealistic price -- $39.99 -- for a product that should cost no more
than a music CD.  Why do companies like Voyager make their
products so expensive?  I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "recouping huge
multimedia costs" -- hey, playing with a Mac is <I>fun</I>, and
it's <I>not that hard</I>.  Until literary/artsy CD-Rom's are available at 
humane prices, they will remain what they are now -- not works for the
people, but trinkets for the wealthy.<P>

Enough editorializing.  See you at Biblio's?<P>
 
<H3>January 16, 1996</H3>

1. <I>
<A HREF="http://www.interport.net/~tribes/">A Gathering of the Tribes</A></I>
is the online presence of a Lower East Side organization comprising an art
gallery, poetry magazine and theatre workshop, among other things.  This 
organization has been a constructive independent force in the downtown arts
scene for several years, but the person who founded it, 
Steve Cannon, may be about to lose the East 3rd Street building
that houses the operation.  This building is Steve's home as well, and the 
word is going out around New York that somebody who has given much help to 
others is now in need of help himself.  Several benefits will be taking place
in the near future; visit the web site or 
<A HREF="mailto:tribes@interport.net">send email to Tribes</A> 
for more info.<P>

2. Please watch this space for info on a Valentine's Day reading of web-related
authors I'm helping to put together somewhere in New York.  We're not exactly 
sure yet what shape this thing is going to take, but if anybody out there is
interested in performing or attending please 
<A HREF="mailto:brooklyn@litkicks.com">drop me a note</A>.  More on this soon ...<P>

<H3>January 3, 1996</H3>

1. I'm happy to kick off the new year with 
'<A HREF="../JCI/JCInterview.html">A Note From Los Gatos</A>'
an interview with John Cassady, a resident of Northern 
California who happens to be the son of
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html"</A>Neal Cassady</A>.<P>

2.  J. D. Salinger and 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html"</A>Jack Kerouac</A>
had a lot in common -- both went to prep school in 
New York and spent the 1950's writing poignant novels 
and discovering
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhism</A> 
-- but I understand that they never liked each other.  
I think Holden Caulfield and
Sal Paradise would have been great friends, though.  
Anyway, I recently came across 
<A HREF="http://www.stardot.com/~lukeseem/holden/">The Holden Server</A>,
a cool little site that delivers a new quote from 
"The Catcher in the Rye" every time you visit it.<P>
