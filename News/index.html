<H3>July 22, 2001</H3>

Okay ... I just got back from an amazing weekend in Northport, Long
Island hanging around with a bunch of people performing at 
<A HREF="http://www.poembeat.com/poembeat.html">this event</A>,
a four-city marathon reading of Kerouac's novel 'Big Sur'. 
I got to spend a lot of time talking with 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=CarolynCassady">Carolyn Cassady</A>, 
who I'd never met before, and who had
flown in from London just for this gathering.  She was even 
more charming and insightful than I had expected.<P>

Another highlight was the marathon reading itself.  'Big Sur' has
enough chapters that most people were able to read their first 
choices, and I selected Chapter Nine.  It was a wonderful honor to
intone these great words into a mic as the David Amram Trio jammed
behind -- a special perk for the New York corner of this four-city
event.<P>

I also learned something I didn't realize about LitKicks    
this weekend, when several people I hadn't seen in months
said to me "Why the hell aren't you updating your Beat News
page?"  And "Why didn't you announce this reading in Beat News?"<P>

The truth is, having introduced message boards on LitKicks
in January, I felt it might be time to retire the Beat News
section of the site.  I introduced message boards so that
anybody could post to the site at any time.  Beat News
is not "postable", and so it seemed old hat to me.  I 
want the message boards at the center of the LitKicks
experience, and I figured I could express anything I 
personally needed to express there instead of here.<P>

But I was surprised to hear that several people don't accept
this reasoning, and in fact think I'm just being lazy in
neglecting this page.  Which is probably true.  So, I'm going 
to try to stop ignoring this page.  Hey, at least I wrote 
something today. <P>

<H3>January 18, 2001</H3>

Poet Gregory Corso died last night at his daughter Sherri's 
home in Minneapolis.  Go
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=GregoryCorso">here</A>
for more ...<P>

<H3>January 15, 2001</H3>

<P>I'm happy to present an addition to this site 
that has been a long time coming.  
As my longtime readers know, there has never been a way
to directly contribute to this site.  When I first launched 
Literary Kicks six and a half years ago, my plan was to invite
contributions by email.  I would review these contributions, edit
them, convert them to HTML -- simple as that.  This not-so-brilliant
plan crash-landed about two years later.  I just couldn't keep up,
and so I switched to plan B: avoiding my email and hiding out 
from my readers.</P>

<P>But even as I hid out, I never forgot my ultimate goal, which was
to create a forum for many diverse voices.  It's taken me a long time
to get my community publishing system off the ground -- partly because
as a technical architect and a Java programmer I needed to put a 
lot of thought into how to do this right.  I've got a long way
to go, but I'm ready to launch a few simple 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/">message boards</A>. 
These are pretty basic -- the innovative stuff is what I hope
will come next.</P>

<P>
In order to add this functionality I've had to move Literary Kicks 
from the server host that has been running it for years to a new host
that specializes in Java servlet integration.  If you are 
linking this site to the old URL,
"http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn",
please change it to the permanent URL, 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com">http://www.litkicks.com</A>, 
instead.  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the folks
at Charm.net for giving me such great service for six and a half years.  
I picked them in 1994 because I liked their name.  Since then the 
internet has grown into the biggest cultural force of its time.  It also 
produced a lot of hysterical investment activity that has now resulted in a
minor stock crash.  The Pets.com sock puppet was born, and the Pets.com sock
puppet has died.  But good companies like Charm.net stick around and 
gradually, intelligently evolve and grow.  Litkicks is trying to do the same.  
So please check these new boards out, and please don't hesitate
to create a member name and be among the first to say hi!</P>

<P>Oh yeah -- happy Martin Luther King Day, and happy 2001.</P>

<H3>December 14, 2000</H3>

<P>1. I've been hearing the hype about e-books for a while.
Surprisingly enough, I think I'm turning into a believer.</P>

<P>The first e-book to catch my attention was 'The Plant'
at 
<A HREF="http://www.stephenking.com/">Stephen King</A>'s
website.  I downloaded the first couple of 
chapters, which were free at the time, and I had
fun reading them.  When it came time for me to start
paying for installments I fell off, not because I 
didn't want to spend two bucks but rather because I
always have too much to read anyway and I 
didn't feel motivated to fill out yet 
another annoying credit card form.  Still,
I *almost* paid for it.  And this was the most 
time I'd invested in reading Stephen King
since 'The Stand' when I was a kid.  So 
overall I'd say my first experience with e-books was 
pleasant and painless.</P>

<P>A couple of weeks ago I tried my second e-book, a 
review copy of Jack Kerouac's 'Orpheus Emerged.'  This is a
previously unpublished story from Kerouac's formative years,
produced in a lively multimedia format
by an electronic publisher called 
<A HREF="http://www.livereads.com/">Live Reads</A>.
While Stephen King's novel was presented in
austere, dignified black-and-white, this book
is a colorful, highly designed hypertext experience.
I'm not tremendously excited by this
particular story, which is in the
same collegiate hyperintellectual vein as Kerouac's
first novel,
'<A HREF="../Books/TownAndCity.html">The Town and the City</A>'.
But I like the idea of Kerouac in e-book form, and I like
what the publisher did to liven up this work.
I also enjoyed toying around with the Adobe E-Book Reader 
as I read.  After I was done I found a nice pile of
free classic novels, poetry books and non-fiction works,
among other things, at the 
<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/epaper/ebooks/ebookslib.html">Adobe E-Book Library</A>.
A free library of classics is a nice touch, and I 
think it's smart for publishers
to keep giving away e-books to help readers
get comfortable with the concept.  I'm looking forward
to what comes next.</P>

<P>Back to traditional formats -- here are a few
new things worth checking out:</P>

2. <A HREF="http://www.firstrunfeatures.com/vid/half.html">Halfmoon</A> 
is a film setting of three stories by 
<A HREF="../People/PaulBowles.html">Paul Bowles</A>, 
and 
<A HREF="http://www.firstrunfeatures.com/vid/bowles.html">Paul Bowles: The Complete Outsider</A>
is a documentary about the writer, created by Catherine Warnow and Regina Weinreich.</P>

3. 
<A HREF="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/f00/lardas.html">The Bop Apocalypse</A>
is a study of the religious significance of the Beat Generation.  A long overdue
topic!</P>

4. 
So George W. Bush is going to be president.  Well, I don't dislike
him nearly as much as I disliked his father.  Not yet, anyway.  And
so far he's saying some decent things about bipartisanship and
reaching beyond divisive party boundaries -- and maybe he'll 
actually deliver on this.  But just in case he doesn't -- a
refresher course in political dissent couldn't hurt, and there
is no better place to start than the recently republished
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568581971/qid=976811001/sr=1-5/002-5461956-4203242">Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman</A>.</P>

<P>5. Beat poetry and punk rock may not seem to have a lot in 
common.  But in downtown New York City, the two scenes have
always travelled together.  This literary/musical intersection
is the subject of an enjoyable new book of essays and interviews, 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306809397/o/qid=976811061/sr=2-2/002-5461956-4203242">Beat Punks</A>
by Victor Bockris, a familiar biographer
and chronicler of the New York downtown
scene.  The East Village is the locale, St. Mark's
Place is the epicenter, and Patti Smith, 
Richard Hell, Allen Ginsberg, William S. 
Burroughs, Debbie Harry and Andy Warhol are the 
characters who show up in these highly
interesting pages.</P>

<H3>September 7, 2000</H3>

<P>Time to report on some interesting new books.  First up are 
two venerable poets, both publishing new works in unusual formats.  Robert 
Creeley has collected the results of an email correspondence with
a group of SUNY Buffalo poetry students into a fresh and 
sophisticated short volume, 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1881471292/qid=968700250/sr=1-18/103-3030447-9560646">Day Book of a Virtual Poet</A>.  Good emails
often make fascinating texts, and this is an excellent experiment
in this new form.</P>

<P>More affectionate and less academic is a new, freewheeling 
book-length ode to a classic Beat: 
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585670375/qid=968337901/sr=1-1/103-3030447-9560646">The Poetry and Life of Allen Ginsberg: A Narrative Poem</A>' 
by <A HREF="../People/EdSanders.html">Ed Sanders</A>.
There is something sweet and wonderful in the fact that 
Sanders felt inspired to honor his friend and compatriot 
in such a heroic manner.  As for the poem itself, it
is very much in the Ed Sanders vein -- modest, exploratory, 
quirky and highly human.</P>

<P>Novelist, poet and multimedia artist Charles Plymell is represented by 
a comprehensive new anthology covering his entire career.
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0934953597/o/qid=969378673/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_3/102-9965029-1649723">Hand on the Doorknob</A>'
is full of personal notes on the true-life characters Plymell 
has worked with during his decades in the artistic underground, 
from Robert Crumb to Neal Cassady.  It also serves to showcase his 
own strong, musical voice as a writer and poet.</P>

<P>Jack Kerouac remains an eternally interesting subject, and two books contribute a 
few new perspectives: 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670861901/ref=sim_books/103-3030447-9560646">Selected Letters, 1957-1969</A>,
is the second, concluding volume in the carefully researched series by Ann Charters.  
One-time Kerouac girlfriend Joyce Johnson, who had previously published her memoir of
the relationship, has now published a volume of their letters to each other, 
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670890405/ref=sim_books/103-3030447-9560646">Door Wide Open: A Beat Love Affair in Letters</A>'.</P>

<P>'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080213694X/qid=968338964/sr=1-1/103-3030447-9560646">Word Virus</A>', 
the extensive and authoritative William S. Burroughs 
collection, is now out in paperback.</P>

<P>The two most interesting new books both describe groups of Beat writers working together 
in particular places.  
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080211668X/o/qid=968257074/sr=2-2/103-3030447-9560646">The Beat Hotel</A>' 
by Barry Miles
captures a spontaneous burst of strange creativity that occured while 
Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Gregory Corso were all slumming
(and escaping the madness of their growing American fame) in a 
Paris hotel during the late fifties and 
early sixties.  This was a fruitful and fascinating minor 
moment in Beat history, well deserving of the detailed 
attention this book provides.</P>

<P>In terms of locale, the Beats were wonderfully bipolar, constantly shooting back
and forth between urban squalor and mountainous desolation.  The "nature consciousness"
side of the Beat legacy is well treated in Rod Phillips new study,
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0820441597/o/qid=968256483/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_3/103-3030447-9560646">Forest Beatniks and Urban Thoreaus</A>.'
The book focuses specifically on Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, Lew Welch, 
and Michael McClure.  (My only complaint is the $45.95 price -- what the 
hell is up with that?  Great way to ensure that the book completely
misses it's potential audience.)</P>

<P>Now, will somebody complete the trilogy and write a book about the 
Beats in suburbia?  I'm imagining chapters on Neal Cassady in San Jose, 
Kerouac in Northport, Long Island, and Ginsberg out there with 
Carl Solomon in Rockland ...</P>

<H3>June 16, 2000</H3>

News for Summer 2000: one rave review, and one complaint.<P>

1. I just saw the new movie version of "Hamlet," starring 
Ethan Hawke and directed by Michael Almereyda.  Folks ... this 
movie is a masterpiece.<P>

I am a bit of an authority on "Hamlet" -- I've read the 
original play about forty times, studied the medieval 
historical legends behind the play, and sat through 
numerous film and stage versions starring folks like 
Kevin Kline (bland but acceptable), Nicol Williamson (spirited 
but flawed) and Mel Gibson (don't even ask).  This new 
version is as good as any I've ever seen, easily the 
equal of the great 1948 Laurence Olivier film, and 
actually more stunning and riveting than that one.  This
is an unusual "Hamlet," set in modern-day Manhattan, 
where Denmark is not a nation but a corporation.  
The actors wear casual clothing and most of
the action takes place in office buildings or 
contemporary New York City apartments.  Yet 
while the play's setting is radically updated, 
Shakespeare's language is left almost completely intact. 
Claudius is the head of the Denmark corporation (replacing 
Hamlet's murdered father), but he is spoken of not as 
CEO or President, but as King, and Hamlet as the Prince.
The movie does not apologize for or even 
acknowledge this utter incongruity -- it is 
the audience's problem to deal with it.  I love the 
nerviness of this approach, and I especially 
love how it allows the language to flow unaltered 
from the original text, even as the imagery often 
contradicts it.<P>

What impresses me most about the movie, though, is the acting. 
Leading men often portray Hamlet as a soporific depressive, 
and I think this is wrong.  Yes, the Prince is sad and 
torn by repressed inner conflicts, but he must  
also be angry, manic, rude and youthfully rebellious.  Ethan 
Hawke -- an actor I've barely been aware of before this 
movie -- captures this perfectly, and I hope he wins an Oscar 
for his performance.  Kyle MacLachlan is excellent as the 
slimy Claudius, Bill Murray is perfect as the aging yuppie 
Polonius, Julia Stiles is poignant and powerful as the 
lovestruck Ophelia (she plays her grand mad scene in 
the Guggenheim Museum) and Diane Venora is convincing 
as the guilty and corrupted Gertrude.  I love the ultra-modern 
touches: Hamlet creates his "mousetrap" play as an indie video, 
and Rosencranz and Guildenstern are comical "Bill and Ted" 
lunkheads who can't help speaking in unison by accident.  
Perfect, perfect all around. <P>

2. Now, the complaint.  I keep seeing ads for the
<A HREF="http://www.askjeeves.com/">Ask Jeeves</A> 
web search service and I'm getting 
sick of it.  The search engine's mascot is the friendly
butler "Jeeves," and it seems that Jeeves the Butler is
becoming a common-use cultural icon, like 
Sherlock Holmes the Detective or Mickey the Mouse.
This annoys me because it presents such a trivialized,
brainless reflection of the brilliant comic writing of P. G.
Wodehouse, one of the great originals of the 20th
Century.<P>

P. G. Wodehouse emerged from the same 
trans-continental jazz age milieu that produced
George Gershwin, the Marx Brothers, Evelyn Waugh and Noel 
Coward, and is best known for his hilarious stories
about an upper-class British layabout named 
Bertie Wooster.  Wooster was a lover of easy living and 
heavy drinking, and he often needed to 
rely on Jeeves, his remarkable and discreet valet, to
pry him out of complicated situations.  These stories
are light and fun to read, but they also hold up
well to sophisticated literary analysis, and there
is a particularly fascinating subtext behind the 
character of Bertie Wooster.  Wooster narrates the 
stories himself, and makes a point of reminding us
constantly that he is not very bright, a judgement
most of his friends and relatives seem to agree with.
This is part of the joke of these stories, and adds to 
the fun, but a close reading actually shows a deeper
truth.  Wooster as narrator has a 
stunning talent for language, an awesome ability 
to capture the essence of the people he sees in pithy
and sparkling sentences (just off the top of my head, 
I'm remembering his description of a fat kid on the 
beach "meditatively smacking a jellyfish with a spade").  
The narrator's felicitousness with both spoken and 
written language proves him to be quite intelligent; and 
the reader's conclusion is that 
the character is not actually dumb 
at all, but rather pretends to be dumb so as to avoid 
having to get a job or take on any responsibility in life.<P>

Adding a Joycean textual twist is the fact that all but
one of the Wooster/Jeeves stories are narrated by Wooster;
a single story, "Bertie Changes His Mind," is narrated
instead by Jeeves.  This allows us a rare glimpse 
into the motivations of this inscrutably perfect butler.  It 
turns out that Jeeves is fully aware of his subject's moral 
limitations, and is not so much a perfect butler as, to use 
contemporary language, some sort of morally dubious 
co-dependent or "enabler".  Do what you will with 
all this literary psychoanalysis, but my main point is 
that it is offensive for the Ask Jeeves website to 
appropriate the Jeeves character and portray him
as some namby-pamby kind of eager do-gooder 
with a smug smile and a deep urge to help me find
the best price for car insurance.
I don't care if they officially licensed the character
from the Wodehouse estate or whatever -- they never 
licensed it from the public domain of my heart.
So I am now officially boycotting the Ask Jeeves
search engine -- even though I think the natural language 
processing it offers is pretty good.<P>

So that's the LitKicks recommendation for the summer.  
Run, don't walk, to see this new movie version of Hamlet.
If you want something to read pick up a copy 
of 
'<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140284087/qid=961508680/sr=1-5/104-2376519-9062346">Carry On, Jeeves</A>' 
or any other collection of the 
Wodehouse stories.  And if you need to search the 
web, I recommend you visit
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">Google</A>.<P>

<H3>April 14, 2000</H3>

Sorry I've been gone so long.  I know some people 
think I died; I assure you this is not true.<P>

It is true, though, that I've been avoiding my 
responsibilities as owner of this site.  I've been 
going through a sort of dark night of the soul recently, 
and dealing with some heavy things in my life that I don't 
want to talk too much about, except to put it in brief: my 
marriage broke up last year, around the beginning of 
September.  Meg and I are both doing fine, and the kids are 
too.  But it's a heavy thing to go through and to be 
honest I just haven't cared about Jack Kerouac or Allen 
Ginsberg or hypertext poetry or web-based fiction much 
lately.<P>

I'm sure I'll get my enthusiasm back, 
and in the meantime I've been 
trying to think of ways to make Literary Kicks feel 
newer and more exciting, since it really hasn't been 
redesigned or rethought since it's birth more than 
five years ago (wow, it has been a long time).<P>

I haven't crystallized my ideas much yet, but I know I 
want to start putting up some streaming video (yeah, 
I bought an iMac, tangerine, what a great 
machine).  I also want to move beyond the Beat 
Generation and start covering a greater diversity of 
styles and genres.  Most importantly, I want to open 
up the site to contributions from others, and turn it from a 
solo act into more of an ensemble performance.<P>

Anyway, that's all coming at some time in the future ... 
unless it isn't, in which case it's not.  As for what's 
happening out in the big world out there these days ... 
well, here are a few things that recently caught my eye.<P>

1. Best new beat-related book so far this millennium: 
"Poems for the Nation", edited by Allen Ginsberg 
with Andy Clausen and Eliot Katz.  This is a book of 
current political poems Ginsberg was putting together 
at the time he died.  It features poems by Tuli Kupferkerg, 
Eileen Myles, Janine Pommy Vega, Anne Waldman, Amiri 
Baraka and many more.  One reason I like the book is the 
personal enthusiasm of one of it's editors, the poet 
Eliot Katz, who is a true modern-day left-wing activist who 
told me excitedly about the book one Sunday on the Lower 
East Side as he ran from a poetry reading to a secret 
meeting of provacateurs who were planning to crash a
World Bank/International Money Fund meeting in Washington D.C. 
Another reason I like this book is that 
it's small and quick to read and costs only six bucks 
(I'm sick of Beat books that cost $40.00).  You can 
buy a copy 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1583220127/o/qid=955765606/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/102-8750399-2934414">here</A>.<P>

2. A sad recent death: 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/eschaton/hyperborea.html">Terence McKenna</A>, 
a popular and much admired social critic of the neo-psychedelic 
school, in the tradition of Carlos Castaneda, Timothy Leary, etc.  
I wasn't personally familiar with his work (I've never been 
into psychedelics myself -- I took magic mushrooms once but 
nothing too special happened) but I've heard from many that 
McKenna was a truly original thinker and a 
very nice person.  It's very sad that he died in the 
middle of a healthy happy life in Hawaiian seclusion, a 
victim of cancer at the age of 52.<P>
 
3. On to the living: the great iconoclast Paul Krassner,
who has been editor of the hippie propaganda rag "The Realist" for 
longer than I've been alive,
now has 
<A HREF="http://www.nancysnetwork.com/pkpage.htm">a web presence</A>.
Krassner has done some interesting 
things with "The Realist" over the years -- for instance, he got in 
big trouble after the Kennedy assassination by accusing Lyndon B. 
Johnson of fucking Kennedy's bullethole on Air Force One.  And I hear 
that was one of the tamer articles.  Well, we all need a little 
realism, so catch a rare New York City appearance by Krassner, if 
you can, at an Earth Night party at the 
<A HREF="http://www.bitterend.com/">Bitter End</A> 
on April 22 -- it's an all-night poetry jam also 
featuring David Amram, Bob Holman, Frank Messina and many others.<P>

April is the cruelest month.  Still, I believe 
things are looking up.  You know, I don't believe 
in Jesus any more than I believe in magic mushrooms, but 
Easter is coming soon, and Patti Smith has a new CD out, 
and it's time to think for me about resurrection.  So check back 
with me soon and hopefully I'll have an all-new, all-different 
Literary Kicks here to show you.  Or maybe not.<P>

<H3>December 15, 1999</H3>

The new millennium is coming and ... novelist 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/heller.htm">Joseph Heller</A>
has died.  I recently reread Heller's classic World War II black comedy 
"Catch-22", and found it funny and rewarding -- a 
cry against conformist thinking that
stands alongside Kafka's "The Castle" and Orwell's "1984" and also seemed 
very much related to Ken Kesey's contemporaneous "One Flew Over 
The Cuckoo's Nest".  I'm sure this book will continue to be
read by generations to come.<P>

I was also sorry to hear of the ailing health of 
<A HREF="http://www.peanuts.com/">Peanuts</A>
creator Charles M. Schulz, who announced that he will no 
longer be creating new strips.  "Peanuts" was a part of America's
post-war countercultural consciousness as much as "Catch-22",
"Cuckoo's Nest" or even "Howl".   I always thought the 
little kids would have grown up to be beatniks ... Schroeder would
have moved on from Beethoven to Lennon and 
Dylan, and the way Linus always quoted scripture, I'm sure
he would have gotten into I Ching and Zen.  Charles Schulz 
never used the strip to air his political or societal 
beliefs -- but hey, we knew what he meant when
he named the bird "Woodstock". <P>

The new millennium is coming ... and if Charlie
Brown will really be gone, I think the 1950's 
are now truly over.  I wonder what will come next?<P>

Happy New Year everybody!  Literary Kicks will be
changing a lot soon.  See you on the other side ...<P>

<H3>November 19, 1999</H3>

The novelist
<A HREF="../People/PaulBowles.html">Paul Bowles</A>
has died of a heart attack at the age of 88.  He had earlier
this month been taken to a hospital in 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>
where he had lived since 1947.  Paul Bowles, an 
elegant expatriate with a refreshing tolerance
for human differences and frailties, was a
friend and inspiration to many of the younger Beat 
writers, like William S. Burroughs and 
Allen Ginsberg, who followed his direction in 
finding an oasis from overbearing Western
civilization in Tangier.<P>

<H3>November 5, 1999</H3>

I've written a lot here about
<A HREF="http://www.fmp.com/amram">David Amram</A>'s
appearances at poetry readings and events recently,
but now a more serious event has 
occurred.  The farmhouse where David lives with his
family, in Peekskill Valley just north of New York
City, has burnt down.  The house was not 
insured, the family is seeking shelter with
friends, and a fund has been set up for those
who want to help the situation with a small
(or large) contribution.   The mailing 
address is:<P>

David Amram<BR>
c/o Toshi and Pete Seeger<BR>

(checks made out to David Amram and marked "gift" are tax-deductible)<P>

I don't make a practice of mentioning 
fund-raising efforts
in these pages, but David is one of the most
generous and good-hearted people I've ever met,
and I know there are people out there who have
gotten a lot out of his music and would like
the chance to give something back now that it
is needed.  If you'd like to know about a benefit
performance that will take place somewhere early
next year, write to Brian Hassett at 
<A HREF="mailto:karmacoupe@aol.com">karmacoupe@aol.com</A>.
And, if you've never seen David sing
or play piano (or french horn, or guitar, or 
his collection of Native American flutes, etc.)
you can buy his excellent new CD, 
<I>'<A HREF="http://www.fmp.com/amram/southern_stories.html">Southern Stories</A>'</I>
and hear what everybody's been raving about.<P>

<H3>October 8, 1999</H3>

1. I'd always wanted to see a production of Beat poet 
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure's</A> 
controversial hippie-era-vintage play "The Beard", 
which was the subject of a famous 
Los Angeles censorship battle back when Ronald
Reagan was governor of California (other famous 
censorship targets in that era included "The Love Book" by 
<A HREF="../People/LenoreKandel.html">Lenore Kandel</A>).
The play has just been revived in a 
thoughtful new production by the venerable
<A HREF="http://www.lamama.org/">La Mama Etc.</A> 
theater in the East Village in New York, so 
I got my wish.<P>

I was curious to see, thirty years after the Los
Angeles police attempted in vain to shut the play 
down, just what the fuss had been about.  I 
was expecting something wildly offensive, and 
was surprised to find a quiet, subtly shaded and 
intelligent dialogue play about the different 
ways men and women approach sex.  There were only
two characters: an archetypal male played by an
actor who looked slighly like
Kid Rock wearing a cowboy outfit, and an archetypal woman 
who resembled Courtney Love 
in platinum-blonde mode.  This man and woman spend 
the entire play -- literally, the entire play -- 
philosophically debating whether or not they should 
have sex.  This might sound somewhat tedious 
(actually, it sounds like a lot of my dates 
when I was in college), but the concept is 
relevant enough to make it add up to a memorable 
statement, and an enlightening evening.<P>

In fact the primal battle between men and 
women is a familiar theme -- the play reminded
me especially of the cartoons of male and female
armies engaged in civil war that James Thurber used
to draw, and also of similar "symbolic" treatments
of the sexual dialectic like "No Exit" by Jean-Paul
Sartre (in which a triangle of three characters 
illustrate the theme) or "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf" by Edward Albee (which gives us two matched 
pairs, a total of four).  McClure keeps the 
concentration on the primal two.  His approach
to drama is cool and diagrammatic, with none of 
the emotional build-up and release of a 
Tennessee Williams or Arthur Miller play -- just
the endless Escher-like curving-back-upon-itself 
of the "big question", as the man and woman 
discuss it over and over and over (yeah, 
the more I think about it, this was a <I>lot</I>
like one of my college dates).  <P>

I'm happy to report that the iconic characters do have sex in 
the end, symbolically at least.  In the final moment 
before the curtain drops (actually there is no curtain, but 
whatever) the blonde woman acheives a blissful sonic orgasm.  
I admit to being slightly disappointed that she never took 
any of her clothes off (what's up with that?) and maybe some 
women in the audience were disappointed that Kid-Rock-Boy 
didn't either.  Pretty incredible to think that, back in
the sixties, they shut down a theatre for presenting
<I>ideas</I> about sex.  I think (I hope) we've come
a long way since then.<P>

If you can't come to New York City to see this play 
in person, check out the fragment of the script
on McClure's own excellent 
<A HREF="http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/mcclure/mcclurea.htm">web page</A>,
which also presents some of his interesting poetry.<P>

2. Holy Shit!  There's an amazing site of free 
literary MP3's at
<A HREF="http://www.mp3lit.com/">MP3Lit.com</A>.   
Everybody from Sylvia Plath to Nicole Blackman, 
Henry Rollins to Noam Chomsky to 
Mumia Abu-Jamal to Tom Wolfe.  A great selection, 
and a great public service.  The site is fairly new 
and should grow quickly, but I hope the interface 
remains as simple as it is now.  I'm looking 
forward to the upcoming "Loudmouth" section 
where unknowns can present their own fiction 
and poetry -- should be some interesting results 
there.  Do not miss checking this place out.<P>

3. The New York Mets are back in the playoffs for the 
first time since 1988 -- a very good sign for the coming 
millennium.  Literary Kicks says "Let's go Mets!"<P>

<H3>August 21, 1999</H3>

1. The 
<A HREF="../Events/BitterEnd.html">Literary Kicks Summer Poetry Happening</A>
at the Bitter End in New York City
turned out to be an amazing night -- read 
all about it and check out some pictures
<A HREF="../Events/Happening.html">here</A>.<P>

Also, Bob Holman was nice enough
to remember the event by putting up the words
spoken by Charles Plymell
<A HREF="http://poetry.about.com/library/weekly/aa072799.htm?pid=2734&cob=home">here</A>.<P>

2. Speaking of the Bitter End event 
(no, I can't seem to stop speaking of it), one 
of the reasons I'd thought to invite Lee
Ranaldo to participate in it was that he's
been working with Jim Sampas and 
<A HREF="http://www.rykodisc.com/">Rykodisc</A>
to collect some of 
Jack Kerouac's best unreleased recordings 
onto a CD.  The CD is 
a revelatory collection that anybody who is 
 interested in understanding Kerouac will want to hear.  While 
Kerouac's existing poetry albums are sometimes
hard to listen to (I always found them somewhat
stiff and difficult to enjoy compared to his
written work), these newfound recordings of Jack's are
charming, musically adventurous and surprisingly
satisfying.  Highlights include a plaintive
version of the pop standard 'Rain or Shine',
some complex verbal blues choruses set to music 
by David Amram, a 28-minute
prose reading from 'On The Road' and, to
top it all off, a rocker by Tom Waits with
Primus (yeah!).  This CD will be released in 
early September.<P>

3. 
'<A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181833">The Source</A>',
a well-researched and intelligent new documentary full-length
film about the origins of the Beat Generation and its main 
players, 
is coming out in a couple of weeks.  Directed by 
Chuck Workman (who also directed a movie about 
the Andy Warhol scene, 
'<A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0103008">Superstar</A>'
), the film focuses heavily on 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>,
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>,
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>
and 
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>, 
and tries hard to fairly represent many other writers.  It adds up
to an informative and breezily entertaining introduction
to this literary movement.  Among the good points: 
the facts are accurate (though the chronology gets confused),
and there are no boring talking-head shots of men 
in sweaters sitting in front of bookcases (thank God).  At
the same time I didn't find the film completely different
enough -- much of the footage was familiar, and the 
summary style was pretty much the same as that of all 
those $35 coffeetable books about 
the Beat Generation that keep popping up in bookstores, 
whereas I wished to be taken somewhere new, to see some
challenging connections made, either 
politically, spiritually, aesthetically or in any other
way.  A captivating filmed scene of actor John Turturro 
screaming the hell out of the great poem 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>'
in an urban schoolyard is probably as "out there" as the
movie ever gets, and this was for me the most memorable
moment in the film.  But even if 'The Source' 
sticks basically to the middle
of the road, the movie is well worth watching, and 
nobody will regret the time spent soaking in the familiar 
footage of our lovable literary stooges, one more time.<P>

4. And one lovable literary stooge who <I>never</I>
played it safe was underground poet 
<A HREF="../People/DALevy.html">d. a. levy</A>.  
I was happy to walk into Barnes and Noble recently and
see, next to all those coffeetable books, the
first trade edition collection of his works: 
' <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1888363886/o/qid=935289552/sr=8-2/002-7709289-5770039">The Buddhist Third Class Junkmail: The Art and Poetry of d. a. levy</A>,' 
edited by Mike Golden.  
This guy was weird and a true original -- check this shit out.  <P>

<h3>June 20, 1999</h3>  

<p>1. The late satirist/writer Terry Southern 
is the subject of a new website, 
<a href="http://www.terrysouthern.com/">terrysouthern.com</a>, 
composed by his son Nile Southern. It's good to be able to 
enjoy these great nuggets of late-period hipster 
culture (Southern wrote the screenplay for 
'<a href="../Films/EasyRider.html">Easy Rider</a>', 
among many other films and books). It's also nice 
to see a new trend growing: adult children of 
beat writers putting together websites as personal 
tributes to their parents (cf. 
<a href="http://www.jackmicheline.com/">jackmicheline.com</a> 
and Zane Kesey's 
<a href="http://www.key-z.com/">key-z.com</a>). 
Today is Father's Day -- so check out these links.</p>  <p>

2. The not-very prolific Buddhist/beat poet 
<a href="../People/PhilipWhalen.html">Philip Whalen</a> 
has a new book out: 'Overtime: Selected Poems'.</p>  <p>

3. If you can make it to New York City on July 21, come to 
<a href="http://www.bitterend.com/">The Bitter End</a> 
in Greenwich Village for a kick-ass poetry reading I'm 
putting together. The occasion is the 5th birthday, 
believe it or not, of this website. I'm putting this 
show together with my poet friend Brian Hassett, who 
arranged a couple of excellent shows I participated 
in earlier this year at the Living Room in the Lower 
East Side.</p>  

<p>One thing that made these shows so good was the 
presence of David Amram, an extremely talented and very 
serious musician who was Jack Kerouac's own piano player, 
back when Jack used to read poetry on stage. David 
generously offered to improvise behind a few of us 
less-seasoned neo-Beats as we read our own poems, 
and the amazing thing about the way he accompanies 
live poets is that he actually <i>listens</i> and 
plays according to what he hears -- no matter how 
humble or unimportant the reader or the words. He also 
does some songs of his own, and I'm very glad that 
he'll be at this event. Other special guests will include 
John Cassady, Neal's son, who'll be playing guitar and 
telling a story or two, poets Richard Hell, Lee Ranaldo, 
Ron Whitehead, Bob Holman, Herschel Silverman, Breath 
Cox and haiku master Cor van den Heuvel. And on the 
newer edge, representing the other side of Literary 
Kicks, I've invited a bunch of my webby friends to get 
on stage and kick some shit around -- Mark Thomas of 
Sorabji, Leslie Harpold of Smug, Christian Crumlish and 
Briggs Nisbet of Enterzone, Xander Mellish, Meg 
Wise-Lawrence and Phil Zampino. It's going to be 
a wild night -- 
<a href="../Events/BitterEnd.html">check out the program</a> 
and I really hope you can make it.</p>  

<h3>April 4, 1999</h3>  

<p>There's nothing like a good, well-managed and highly 
bizarre personal web content site. The following are 
some of my recent favorite sites, all of them run by 
individuals who embody Ralph Waldo Emerson's ideal of 
the 'self-reliant' artist. They create their web works 
for no reason other than to express the uniqueness 
of their own personalities. And none of them seem to 
care much if anybody likes what they do. The creative 
web is alive ...</p>  

<p>Let's start on the purely visual end of the spectrum, 
with the psychologically psychedelic art musings of 
Jef Morlan, a master of Macromedia Flash whose works 
are inspired by the Flemish artists of the Dutch 
Renaissance. Jef lives somewhere inside 
<a href="http://www.snarg.net/"><i>Snarg.net</i></a>, 
the site he has been building and rebuilding for 
the last several years.</p>  <p>Not much less weird 
is Mark Napier's 
<a href="http://www.potatoland.org/"><i>PotatoLand.org</i></a>. 
Where Jef Morlan uses Flash and digital video, Mark Napier's 
basic tool is the Java programming language, which he uses 
mainly to shred and disassemble the components of our 
familiar media world in as many ways as he can.</p>  

<p>Now let's leave the chilly realms of these two abstract 
visual artists and move towards the warmer, more 
internally introspective side of the spectrum. Drop by 
<a href="http://www.sorabji.com/"><i>Sorabji.com</i></a> 
to see what astute thoughts are currently engaging the 
cluttered mind of web innovator Mark Thomas, who seems 
to enjoy arranging odd interactions between people by 
listing pay telephone numbers, creating an infinite 
stream of querelous chat boards, and sneaking digital 
photographs of strangers on the street. His site 
gets a lot of message board traffic from readers, 
and he often keeps quiet for long stretches of time 
and lets them do all the talking, to good effect.</p>  

<p>Then, for a final dose of attitude, 
check out Leslie Harpold's 
<a href="http://www.smug.com/"><i>Smug.com</i></a>.</p>  

<h3>February 28, 1999</h3>  

<p>I go a long way back as a 
<a href="http://www.richardhell.com/HellBio.html">Richard Hell</a> 
fan. I was lucky enough to have been a Long Island high 
school kid during the great punk era of late 70's New York 
City, and every time I could scrape ten bucks together 
I'd jump on the Long Island Railroad to Manhattan, 
walk down to the Village and sneak into bars like CBGB's and 
Max's Kansas City and Irving Plaza where I could catch 
bands like the Ramones, the Mumps, the B-52's and Richard 
Hell and the Voidoids. Richard Hell was one of my 
favorites, a tormented poet bristling with a romantic 
punk anger that seemed somehow 
rooted in a dark European mood of 
absinthe and Symbolism, who yelled bleary angry 
lyrics to a hypercharged angular minimalist 
pogo beat, catchy and violent and loud, even 
good fun power pop within all the obvious anger. 
These were amazing nights; I caught about ten Voidoids shows 
during these years, and when their album 'Blank Generation' 
came out I played it constantly and loved it. 
But they never really crossed-over and 
became a big hit like the 
Ramones or Blondie or Talking Heads. </p>  

<p>Then the 80's began. Reagan became President, 
MTV was invented, the culture of money-style 
replaced the culture of art-style in New York City, 
and Richard Hell was gone from public view. I was in 
college during these years, and I wasn't listening to 
Hell much any more. I soon started forgetting to even 
remind myself to remember Richard Hell or the Voidoids, 
and then eventually like a stuffed animal left at 
home I came to forget them completely.</p>  

<p>Then around the mid-90's Hell suddenly resurfaced -- 
still living in New York City, still looking drugged-out 
and underfed and tired and angry, in fact looking not 
much different than he'd looked before. Except now he 
was the author of a brilliant, sparklingly well-written 
first novel, 'Go Now', which had somehow been published 
not by some downtown indie zine shop (which is what 
anyone would have expected for Hell) but by an imprint 
of the refined mass-market publishing conglomerate 
Simon and Schuster. The novel, a semi-autobiography 
in a neo-Beat flavor, even got excellent reviews 
in respectable magazines and newspapers. I have 
no idea how Hell pulled this marketing coup off, 
except that the book was good enough to deserve 
every bit of attention it got. Maybe quality and 
artistic integrity really <i>does</i> still count for 
something in large-corporate publishing (though there 
aren't many other indications of this these days).</p>  

<p>But will 'success' go to Richard Hell's head? 
No fucking way. He helps to run CUZ Editions, 
his own indie publishing shop, and he produces 
occasional strange, appealing literary experiments 
like a recent book of poetry in which every page 
is a slightly different version of the same single, 
simple poem. You can find out more about 
this and other stuff at the 
<a href="http://www.richardhell.com/">CUZ website</a>. 
There's also an interesting recent interview with 
Hell in the music zine 
<a href="http://www.furious.com/perfect/richardhell.html"><i>Perfect Sound Forever</i></a>.
</p>  

<h3>February 2, 1999</h3>  

<p>1. Lots of people have heard about the excellent 
Kurt Vonnegut graduation speech that got sent all over the 
internet last year before everybody figured out that 
Vonnegut never gave the speech. But here, and also pretty good, is 
<a href="http://www.duke.edu/~crh4/vonnegut/ginsberg.html">something Kurt Vonnegut actually did say</a>. </p>  

<p>2. If you're in New York: there'll be a big Burroughs 
tribute bash Saturday, Feb 5 at 1 pm at St. Mark's Church 
in the East Village, with folks like Steve Buscemi, Richard 
Hell, Barry Miles, Maggie Estep, James Graueurholz reading. 
Then on Wednesday, Feb 10 at 7:30, there'll be a big messy 
Kerouac bash at the Living Room on 84 Stanton St in 
Soho, with readings by folks like Ann Douglas, 
David Amram, David's daughter Adira Amram, Frank Messina, 
Brian Hassett and me.</p>  

<H3>January 8, 1999</H3>  

<p>Sorry I've been away so long. I've been taking a 
break, but I promise soon I'll be my old chatty 
self again.</p>  

<p>Not much to report here anyway. The music/poetry 
duo of former Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek and 
<a href="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</a> 
is hitting the road again, and I'm looking forward to 
seeing them play the Bottom Line here in New York City 
next Tuesday, January 12. There's also a new 
<a href="http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&amp;d/mcclure/mcclure.htm">website</a> 
devoted to McClure, which he participated in creating.</p>  

<p>Also, it looks like James Grauerholz did an awesome 
job in putting together the most comprehensive 
collected edition of writings by 
<a href="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</a>. 
The book is called 
'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802116299/qid=915835982/sr=1-1/002-6353976-6729062">Word Virus</a>', 
and it's good stuff. I'm going into hiding 
again, be back soon ...</p>
