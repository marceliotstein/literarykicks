Beat News Archive: 1995</H1>

<I>(Yes, this is a photo of Burroughs and Kerouac, apparently
posing as private detectives)</I><P>

<H3>December 14, 1995</H3>

1. 
<A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com">HotWired</A>
is running a series of pastel artworks by Francesco Clemente
annotated by 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>.  
The series is called 
'<I><A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/workshop/95/49/index1a.html">Pastel Sentences</A></I>.'<P>

2. "Poetry in Motion" and "Poetry in Motion II", two new CD-Roms from 
<A HREF="http://www.voyagerco.com">Voyager</A>,
are pretty good.  They feature spoken word 
and musical performances by poets and writers like Allen Ginsberg, 
Diane DiPrima, 
Jim Carroll, 
<A HREF="../People/AnneWaldman.html">Anne Waldman</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> 
and Ed Sanders.
The interface is clean and unpretentious, 
and the poetry readings are presented in short, pleasurable bursts,
none longer than a few minutes.  Diane DiPrima's "Light," accompanied by a 
hypnotic tingly piano and flashes of colored lights, is one of my favorite 
pieces.  Overall rating: excellent Xmas present!<P>

3. Check this out: a few months ago I received an e-mail from a Norweigan 
translator named Dag Heyerdahl Larsen who was working on the first 
Norwegian edition of Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Aid 
Acid Test." He needed help with some Americanisms (like
"Shazam" and "Baskin-Robbins") and I had fun trying to answer his
questions (though many of Tom Wolfe's references make no sense no matter
how well you know the language).  The book is now out in Norway, and 
it's called "Syreproven," which means "Acid Test" -- Dag 
explained to me that the best direct translation of the full title would have
meant "The Acid Test Based On Electric Kool-Aid."  I agreed with him that this
just didn't have that 'ring.'  He also told me that nobody in Norway 
knows what Kool-Aid is.<P>

Dag mailed me a copy, and it was fun to see my name in the appendix, surrounded 
by all kinds of strange Norwegian text.   I wonder what he said about me?<P>

4.  I've been wanting to write an update on the much-talked-about 
Francis Ford Coppola film of 
"<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>," 
but unfortunately 
I have no hard information to present.  I've heard many things -- it's
on, it's off, it's on again but Coppola's son will direct ... 
I heard from one very good source that Woody Harrelson was actually
signed to play Dean Moriarty, which is what I recommended in the very
first Beat News entry (at the bottom of this page).  But now that I've
thought about this, I don't even know if I agree with myself that this
would be good, and anyway I heard from others that it's not even true.  <P>

Other Beat-related film projects are also in discussion stages, including some
involving 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
and/or 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>
(the two real-life principals in "On The
Road.")  Nothing, I understand, is definite.  At this point, I'd be just as 
happy to hear that none of these films will be made.  There's too much Beat
hype lately anyway, and we're all getting sick of it.<P>

5. Speaking of Beat hype: when I started Literary Kicks in the summer of '94
almost nobody was talking about the Beats.  What happened?  Back then, I didn't
even start a Beat News page for the first few months, because there <I>was</I>
no Beat News.  Now ... forget it.  I knew it was getting out of hand
when Literary Kicks got mentioned in a fairly brain-dead article about the Beat
phenomenon in Vogue magazine.  According to Vogue, the Beat 
Generation was all about clothing!  Well well, I learn something new every 
day ...<P>

Anyway, I used to try to capture every Beat-related URL on the Web somewhere in
these pages, but this has recently become impossible.  There's just too much
stuff out there.  I will continue to put stuff I consider particularly 
interesting in this page, but if anyone else wants to create and maintain a 
more comprehensive page of Beat listings and links, I will happily make it a 
part of Literary Kicks.  I wish I had time myself, but I honestly don't.  Any 
volunteers?  <P>

Coming soon: my e-mail interview with John Cassady, Neal's son.<P>

<H3>November 14, 1995</H3>

1. I'm proud to present in these pages an original work of fiction by 
Jan Kerouac.  This is an excerpt from Jan's newest and
not-yet-published novel 'Parrot Fever,' and the reason I'm proud to 
present it is not that she's Jack's daughter, but rather that I like the
story very much.  I hadn't read any of Jan's fiction before, and was 
surprised and pleased by this clever and gently hopeful piece.  
<A HREF="../IKL/Parrot.html">Here it is</A>.  <P>

2. The Beat exhibit at the Whitney Museum in New York is now open.  This is
a very thorough and well-planned survey of the universe of Beat-related art
and culture, focusing heavily on the works of several not-especially-well-known
artists of the 50's and 60's, such as Wallace Berman, Jay Defeo, and Bruce 
Conner, as well as some better known names like Larry Rivers and
Robert Rauschenberg.  The exhibit is
organized into rooms representing Beat locales, like Los Angeles,
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A> 
and New York.  There are many artifacts and literary collectibles on exhibit
as well, including the original scroll manuscripts (behind glass) of
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>'
and
'<A HREF="../Books/DharmaBums.html">Dharma Bums</A>,' 
as well as the original typewritten
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>.' <P>

My impression?  I liked it more than I thought I would.  I hadn't expected
such a comprehensive, sweeping presentation.  Most of the actual artworks 
were dark, sardonic and depressing, as befits the era of cultural repression
and nuclear fear.  However the work I liked best was probably a small and
lovingly wrought collage of cut-out church steeples put together by poet
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>,
who is not generally thought of as a visual artist.<P>

The Whitney gift shop also has lots of new Beat-related goodies, and I
was unable to leave there without getting mugged for $150.  The good news:
I now finally own, along with lots of pretty-colored stuff I don't need, 
the video of "Pull My Daisy," which I'll write up here as
soon as I find the time.<P> 

3. Daniel Pinchbeck, the son of Beat chronicler (and Jack Kerouac's former 
lover) Joyce Johnson, wrote an article on "Children of the Beats" for last 
Sunday's New York Times Magazine (Nov. 5).  He interviewed Jan Kerouac,
Parker Kaufman (son of poet 
<A HREF="../People/BobKaufman.html">Bob Kaufman</A>), 
Village Voice writer Lisa Jones (daughter of Amiri Baraka and Hettie Jones),
John Cassady, Neal's other son Curt Hansen and 
others.  Several of the interviews focused on the horrible
parenting skills of the Beats, and the Kerouac and Kaufman sections in 
particular seemed to show hopeless lives in the process of self-destruction.<P>

Without a doubt Kerouac and Kaufman were not
father-of-the-year material, but the article struck me and others I spoke to
as overly dark.   Even the excerpt from Jan Kerouac's novel that I mentioned
above shows a bright side that this article does not portray.
And as someone in the BEAT-L mailing list asked, why weren't the successful 
grown children of Michael McClure and Gary Snyder 
included?   In any event, the Jones and Cassady/Hansen interviews avoided tragic
overtones, and the article was definitely interesting and provocative.<P>

The New York Times also gave the Whitney exhibit (see above) a shitty review
the day after the opening. <P>

4. This is late notice, but Jim Carroll is appearing in an online chat at
<A HREF="http://www.sonicnet.com">Sonic Net</A> 
tomorrow (Nov. 15) at 7 pm.  You might also want to check out Sonic Net's
"Shows" section to catch Allen Ginsberg (of all people) interviewing 
Beck and members of Hole at this summer's Lollapolooza.<P>

<H3>October 31, 1995</H3>

1. According to the New York Times, the writer Terry Southern has died.
I've been meaning to write a page on him anyway, so 
<A HREF="../People/TerrySouthern.html">here it is</A>.<P>

2. The new 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
CD-ROM is finally out.  There is a lot of fascinating material here -- 
photos never before seen, many letters and manuscripts, the complete
annotated text of 
'<A HREF="../Books/DharmaBums.html">The Dharma Bums</A>.'
I think all devoted Kerouac readers will find it valuable.
Viking Penguin and author Ralph Lombreglia (who oversaw the project)
should be commended for putting together a dignified and solid
presentation.  And it only crashes my PC about once every two hours, 
perhaps a duration record for a CD-ROM.<P>

Only one negative note: with hundreds of photos, including many distantly
related family members, why no picture or mention of estranged daughter
<A HREF="../People/JanKerouac.html">Jan Kerouac</A>?  
A good tribute like this is meant to last for the ages, and should strive 
to rise above family squabbles.<P>

3. Literary Kicks was chosen by 
<A HREF="http://www.gnn.com/">GNN</A> 
as one of the nominees for 
<A HREF="http://www-e1c.gnn.com/gnn/wic/botn/index.html">Best of the Net 1995.</A>
I'm also psyched that my friends who run
<A HREF="http://enterzone.berkeley.edu/enterzone.html">Enterzone</A> 
were chosen as well.  <P>

Best of the Net is nice, but New York Press selected Literary Kicks
as "Best Web Site Run By A New Yorker" in their annual Best-of issue,
and that gives me special bragging rights here on the Manhattan
streets.  Thanks to everybody for giving me such positive feedback --
I can't pretend I don't love it!<P>

<H3>October 7, 1995</H3>

1. Forty years ago today, a group of unknown poets based in 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A> and
<A HREF="../Places/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</A>
gathered for a poetry reading in a small art space called the
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A>.
Nobody had heard of 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A> 
or
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A> 
before; after this seminal event (attended by only about 
150 people) the whole world seemed to begin to listen to
them.  I've updated my Six Gallery page to include a description of the
building where it took place, sent by Tony Willard.  I also
just finished typing in one of the poems 
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A> 
read that day, a poem I like a lot called 
<A HREF="../Texts/PointLobos.html">Point Lobos: Animism</A>.<P>

2. I finally have a 
<A HREF="../Buk/bukmain.html">Charles Bukowski page</A>! 
This entire section was written by a cyber-buddy of mine,
the legendary "Mountain Bike Mike" McCullough (of 
<A HREF="http://www.magick.net/~michael/music.html">Michael's Music Links</A>).<P>

3. Rob Hardin's 
<A HREF="http://www.users.interport.net/~scrypt/">Paralyzed Paradise/Matterland</A> 
is a pretty fascinating literary experiment, and it's hypertext to the max.<P>

I've sometimes seen Rob Hardin hanging around with the 
Unbearables, a very original group of downtown 
New York writers who've recently published an eponymous book I'm now reading.  
I think my favorite member of this pack is Ron Kolm, who writes complicated 
little urban dramas about hapless used-magazine vendors, cunnilingus fanatics 
and the like.  A strange and compelling sense of karma hangs over these short 
and funny tales. <P>

I find much modern "neo-Beat" literature impenetrable; it's too much of the same
old Burroughs-inspired perverse obscurity, without clear message or plot or 
purpose.  Too many of these writers seem happy to remain where Burroughs left
them, and to aspire only to be as offensive, illogical and inaccessible as they 
possibly can be.  But in writers like Ron Kolm I see signs of a more human 
literature, a return to the territories Richard Brautigan, Gregory Corso, Ed 
Sanders and even Kerouac explored.  Anyway, "The Unbearables" is definitely
worth picking up if you see it, as well as other Unbearable-related (I think) 
zines and publications like "Sensitive Skin", "Rant" and "Redtape".<P>

<H3>September 17, 1995</H3>

1. 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>
has published a new book of essays.  It's called "A Place In Space"
and it's published by Counterpoint.<P>

2. 
Lincoln Center and the New School are presenting a series celebrating
the musical works of 
<A HREF="../People/PaulBowles.html">Paul Bowles</A>,
who was a respected composer (among many other things) before
he left the United States to live in 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>
and became a novelist.  Bowles is currently in New York to attend
these events, and this is a big deal because he has not been to New
York (where he was born 84 years ago, in Jamaica, Queens) since 1969.<P>

3. The two sections of Literary Kicks run by contributors have both
been updated.
<A HREF="../Biblio/SherriBiblio.html">Sherri's Beat Bibliography</A>
now includes an extensive list of writings about Allen Ginsberg, and
<A HREF="../IKL/IKL.html">Inside the Kerouac Legacy</A> 
is publishing a contribution by 
<A HREF="../People/JanKerouac.html">Jan Kerouac</A>,
an open letter to New York University regarding her exclusion from
the recent Kerouac conference sponsored by the University.<P>

4. Happy 60th Birthday to 
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey</A>!<P>

<H3>September 12, 1995</H3>

1. According to an article in the current
<A HREF="http://www.addict.com/ATN/">Addicted To Noise</A>,
Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth has been delving into some
unreleased and previously unknown recordings by
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac</A>, 
and is making plans with Geffen to release the material.  Cool! 
Ranaldo has been known to write some good neo-beat stuff himself, 
in fact.<P> 

2. I have a bunch of literary links to tell you about today: <P>

I wouldn't expect to find myself plugging a website that bills itself
as the "Harbor of the Western Soul and the Conservative Intellectual."
A conservative intellectual is one thing I most decidely am NOT -- but
somehow I like the
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/owl/">Beaconway Press</A>
website anyway.  These guys have a sense of fun, and I always like people 
who have the nerve to state their opinions clearly,
even when their opinions are WRONG.  But seriously ... these guys seem
pretty cool, they know their western lit as well as anyone, and they hate 
the mainstream literary establishment as much as I do (of course they think 
it's too liberal; I just think it's too damn boring!).  But, whatever ... drop
by and see what you think.<P>

Back on safer turf, the 4th episode of
<A HREF="http://enterzone.berkeley.edu/enterzone.html">Enterzone</A> 
is out.  I first heard of Enterzone a year ago, when one of the founders
sent me e-mail asking for a contribution to their first issue.  Since then
they've become my closest literary comrades on the web, and I think the
stuff they're publishing is tremendously original.  <P>

I'm also very enthusiastic about a new novel that Enterzone fiction editor 
Martha Conway has begun serializing on the Web.  Martha is a serious
writer who's been published in many literary journals, and I think it's cool
of her to take a chance on publishing this novel online, as I imagine she 
could have easily published it through more traditional means instead.  It's 
called
<A HREF="http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/~mang/title.html">In Some Unrelated Land</A>,
and it's about a 22-year-old lost soul drifting through Berkeley, 
California after the sudden death of her parents. <P>

Finally, I just discovered the
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/cosmic/cba1.html">Cosmic Baseball Association</A>
which is some sort of fabulously eclectic rotisserie baseball league where the
players are chosen from among the historical luminaries of arts and culture.  
One of the teams is called the 
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/cosmic/95beats.html">Dharma Beats</A>
and you've got to see this lineup.  I can't quite figure this website out, 
which is why I think I like it so much.<P>

The web is really exploding with originality and creativity lately, I think.
All of the above sites are efforts by individuals or small groups of people,
without a lot of money, and probably without a lot of technological resources
either.  All it takes is a little courage, and a lot of time.<P>

3. The Whitney Museum in New York will be presenting a major exhibit of
Beat-related artwork and artifacts beginning November 9.  I'll write more
about this after it opens.<P>

<H3>September 3, 1995</H3>

1. The 8th Annual Lowell Celebrates Kerouac! Festival will be held 
on 4-9 October in 
<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A>,
Massachusetts.  Featured events will include a rare 
performance by Patti Smith with 
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke</A>
and Willie Alexander, 
a variety of walking tours (including several that focus on Kerouac's novel
"Dr. Sax"), a tribute to Charlie Parker, a visit to nearby Walden Pond,
a number of symposiums, an interpretive dance called "Weird Scenes 
from the Gold Mine," and a memorial mass for Kerouac.
For more info, write Lowell Celebrates Kerouac!, Box 1111, Lowell, 
MA 01853 or call the Lowell National Historical Park at (508) 970-5000. <P>

2. I recently purchased the "Haight-Ashbury" CD-Rom (produced by
<A HREF="http://www.rockument.com/">Rockument</A>)
and found a ton of OBC (Official Beat Content) within.  The
project was led by Allen Cohen, who edited San Francisco's 
psychedelic newspaper <I>The Oracle</I> during the sixties, and
much original material from this paper is here, including
articles by 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>,
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>,
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A>,
<A HREF="../People/LewWelch.html">Lew Welch</A>,
<A HREF="../People/LenoreKandel.html">Lenore Kandel</A> and even
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>.
Maybe I bought this one because I'm so tired of waiting for the
Jack Kerouac CD-Rom (produced by Viking Penguin) to finally 
show up.  The word from Viking Penguin is that it will hit the shelves 
very soon, hopefully in the next few weeks.<P>

3. To my surprise, Literary Kicks was chosen as one of the Top 10
Web Sites by 
<A HREF="http://www.pointcom.com/">Point Surveys</A>.  
I showed up as #7 on the Best Overall list for the week of
August 21, and again as #9 (hey! what's the problem here?) for
the week of August 28.  I'm especially proud to be one of the
only non-corporate sites on the list, and also one of the only
ones maintained by a single individual instead of a team.  I was
told by Point Communications that I'm now on their Top 5% of All
Websites list, and so I get to wear this badge:<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../CommercialArt/5perclgt.gif"></CENTER><P>

<H3>August 26, 1995</H3>

1. Viking Penguin has been releasing several new Kerouac publications.  The
only one I've seen so far is <I>Book of Blues</I>, a wonderful collection
of mostly-unpublished Kerouac poems, written in the same jazz-inspired 
'Chorus' form he used for <I>Mexico City Blues</I> and other poetic works.
As in these other works, most of the poems are named after the place 
they were written, and now we even have a couple of poems originating from
my own beloved borough of Queens, New York (where Kerouac lived as a young
man): "Ozone Park Blues" and "Richmond Hill Blues."  I love it!<P>

2. An exhibit of 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>'s 
photographs will be at the Tibor De Nagy 
Gallery on 57th Street in New York City starting September 7.  Call (212) 
421-3780 for more info. <P>

3. What can I say about Jerry Garcia that hasn't already been said?  Nothing,
I guess.  But I recently got a very nice note from John Cassady, 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal's</A> 
son, and among other things he sent me the text of a letter he wrote to
the San Jose Mercury News about his own memories of Jerry.  
<A HREF="../Topics/JCassadyOnGarcia.html">Here it is</A>.<P>

4. I've mostly avoided discussing the hot dispute that has been raging
over the ownership of Kerouac's estate.  This topic has been so much in
the news lately, though, that it seemed almost necessary for me to touch
upon it in these pages.  A great opportunity to do so arose recently when
a Beat aficianado named 
<A HREF="../IKL/RalphVirgo.html">Ralph Virgo</A>
offered to create a special section within Literary Kicks devoted
specially to original writings from people who knew Kerouac or 
have particular expertise regarding his life or work.  The first
installment of 
<A HREF="../Topics/IKL.html">Inside the Kerouac Legacy</A>
features an original article by Kerouac biographer Gerald Nicosia,
who (as many of you may know) has been one of the key figures in the 
recent disputes over Kerouac's estate.  This whole section is Ralph
Virgo's gig -- I'm staying out of it myself ...<P>

Other articles will hopefully follow in this series, focusing on 
a broad range of areas, and not just the matter of the estate.<P> 

5. <I>Tricycle</I>, a popular Buddhist journal, has dedicated a large
part of its latest issue to "Buddhism and the Beat Generation."  They'll
also be publishing a book on the subject, "Big Sky Mind," with writings
by 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>,
<A HREF="../People/LewWelch.html">Lew Welch</A>,
Ginsberg, Joanne Kyger and others.  <I>Tricycle</I> also has
<A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/tricycle/">a new web page</A>.<P>

6. There's a new Ken Kesey home page 
<A HREF="http://www.peak.org/~clapp/kesey/">here</A>.<P>

<H3>August 4, 1995</H3>

Do you like my new Netscape color scheme?  It's not too radical -- although
I've been doing some experimenting in the past couple of weeks,
and some of you may have seen some pretty ugly pages flying by.  I finally
settled on a simple blue/green against a white or black background, blue to
match the Paul Verlaine graphic at the top of my front page, and green 
for the glass of absinthe Verlaine is drinking in that picture, and also
in honor of 
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A>'s 
statement that "the Beat writers are the literary arm of the ecological
movement."<P>

I must admit, though, that I am color-blind (red-green color blind, to 
be exact, which means I see colors, but slightly differently).  So if
anyone really HATES my colors let me know -- I'm trying to be correct
here, but this is kind of like putting on a shirt and a tie for me -- 
I think it's right, but I'm not exactly sure.<P>

Anyway, I've been working hard on LitKicks lately, and there are 
several new things here.  Probably the two I'm most pleased with are
the extensive new bibliographies of published writings about
<A HREF="../Biblio/KerouacBiblio.html">Kerouac</A>
and 
<A HREF="../Biblio/KeseyBiblio.html">Kesey</A>,
both of which were created specially for LitKicks by contributors. 
There's amazing stuff here -- I never knew, for instance, that John 
Updike actually stooped so low as to make fun of Kerouac in 
<I>The New Yorker</I> (man, I hate that guy.)  There's a 
chronological list of reviews of Kerouac's books, and it's 
fascinating to observe the ebb and flow of mainstream literary 
interest in his works over the years.  The Kesey bibliography
also contains fascinating entries I'd never known about.  Thanks
to Sherri and Martin Blank for sending these to me!<P>

<H3>July 14, 1995</H3>

1. Several weeks ago I mentioned Pseudo Online Radio, an excellent radio
show devoted to online culture and happenings that interviewed me live 
and is run by a Beat poet named Galinsky ... well they now have a 
pretty nifty home page as well, and 
<A HREF="http://pseudo.com/forum/index.html">here it is</A>.
They're on WEVD (1050 AM) Thursday nights at 11:00, and are really
worth listening to.<P>

2. I think news of Patti Smith counts as Beat News.  She became 
famous as a punk-rock poet in the mid-70's, but there are lots of 
Beat echoes in her music.  She hung out with Burroughs and chanted
the name of 
<A HREF="../People/ArthurRimbaud.html">Rimbaud</A>
in her songs.  I think that qualifies her ... she was also one
of the great singer-songwriters of her time, in my opinion.
The reason I mention this is that she's doing a live show in 
Central Park (here in NY) on July 27th!  This is happy news 
because she's been in retirement for a long time.  She read
poetry in Central Park a couple of years ago, and it was pretty
good (but kind of quiet).  Now she's bringing ace guitarist Lenny Kaye 
along, and is apparently prepared to <I>rock</I>.<P>

There's a sad subtext to this: Patti's husband Fred "Sonic"
Smith (of MC5) died suddenly in the past year.  I understand Patti's
bringing her two children along as part of this concert tour.  If this
is therapy ... I'll only be applauding that much harder because 
of it.  Maybe I'll see some of you there?<P>

<H3>July 7, 1995</H3>

1. Several months ago a person named Tim Gallaher sent me an 
interesting bunch of .au files of Jack Kerouac's voice.
I've been meaning to put these files up in these pages, 
but Tim got tired of waiting for me and found his own 
web server to place them on, for which I am very grateful.  Here's the 
<A HREF="http://www-hsc.usc.edu/~gallaher/k_speaks/kerouacspeaks.html">link</A>.
And to everybody else who's getting tired of waiting for me to put your 
stuff up: I'm working on it, I promise ...<P>

2. Would you like to know why I've been so busy?  I've been 
trying to finish my new web project, which I'M FINALLY DONE 
WITH!!!  I've really been knocking myself out over this thing, 
and I'd really like it if you'd visit and tell me what you think.
I'm not going to try to describe it except to say that this is
my first attempt at truly expressing myself on the Web.  It's
dedicated to the city where I live, it's inspired by the music
I listen to and the books I read, and it's called 
<I>
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn/Queensboro.html">Queensboro Ballads</A></I>.<P>

3. There's a new internet mailing list dedicated to the Beat Generation.
It's called the BEAT-L, and you can subscribe to it by sending a
SUBSCRIBE BEAT-L message to listserv@cunyvm.cuny.edu.  There's been
some very interesting activity lately, and after three weeks there's
already a minor flame war going on.<P>

4. Penguin is releasing a CD-ROM dedicated to Jack Kerouac.  I haven't
found it in any of the stores here in New York, so I can't say much
about it yet, but there is a very extensive preview available at
Penguin's web site.  Click
<A HREF="http://www.penguin.com/usa/electronic/titles/kerouac">here</A>.<P>

<H3>June 23, 1995</H3>

I forgot to announce this earlier, but the third episode of 
<A HREF="http://enterzone.berkeley.edu/enterzone.html">Enterzone</a>
is out.  Enterzone is marginally beat-related, but that's really just
an excuse -- I'm announcing it here because I like it, and also
because I'm in it.  Martha Conway's <I>Drugs</I> is one of my
favorite stories in this episode. <P>

Another marginally beat-related thing I like a lot is Malcolm 
Humes' work on the web.  Malcolm does the William S. Burroughs
web site (listed below), and has also been exploring some      
obsessive graphical ideas lately, often involving meat,
cheese, photos of the seashore, romance novels, public-domain 
porn and Netscape server-pushes.  His home page is 
<A HREF="http://www.emf.net/~mal/">here</A>.<P>

Both Malcolm and the Enterzone people are independent web
artists (like me).  The business world has really been going
wild on the web lately, hasn't it?  I hear about huge 
commercial web ventures constantly now.  But some of 
us aren't doing this to cash in -- and we were here first.
And we're not leaving, either! <P>

<H3>June 6, 1995</H3>

The Kerouac Conference at NYU is going on right now; please read my 
<A HREF="../Topics/RingsideSeat.html">report</A>
if you want to hear about all the fist-fights and ego flare-ups     
(as well as a fun anti-conference event staged by a literary 
protest group, the Unbearables, of whom I am now an enthusiastic
supporter).<P>

<H3>May 29, 1995</H3>

Damn!  I just accidentally deleted some e-mail before I got a chance to 
respond for the 2nd time this month.  If anybody wrote to me and
didn't get an answer back, please write again -- I'm always happy
to get e-mail, and I *always* write back (unless I do something
stupid like delete the mail).  I've been overwhelmed with feedback lately, 
but it's a good way to be overwhelmed, and I don't want it to stop.<P>

Also, to people who've sent me stuff (especially music/film references,
as well as a few other things): I'm still holding on to your 
material, and am just trying to finish my new project (click
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn/Single.html">here</A> 
for preview) before I start making major additions to 
Literary Kicks.  Once the new project is done, I plan to
devote myself full time to LitKicks again.  Thanks!<P>

<H3>May 22, 1995</H3>

The "Writings of Jack Kerouac" conference at New York University (June
5-6) is coming soon.  Now a mysterious group calling itself the
Unbearables is planning to protest "The Great Beat Sell Out" and
has announced (in alt.books.beatgeneration) the following events:<P>

<I>
June 4, 1995, 2:30 pm.<BR>
The University Theater, 35 W.4th Street<BR>
Rollo Whitehead walking tour.<P>

June 5, 7pm<BR>
Biblio's Cafe, 317 Church St, 212/334-6990<BR>
Jack Kerouac Impersonators Contest.<P>

June 6, 7:15 pm<BR>
Town Hall, on 43rd St btwn 6th & 7th Aves<BR>
A gathering to protest exclusive & expensive reading of Kerouac's poetry.
Bring signs, banners and implements of conspicuous outrage. We'll also
be reading poetry in front of Town Hall for *free*.<P>
</I>

I have no idea if these events are for real, but I did write to the person
who posted the announcement (scrypt@interport.net) and received a friendly
response assuring me that the events would take place.  I still haven't
decided whether to go to the NYU conference or not (I don't like to decide 
things until the last minute), but something tells me I'd find more spontaneity
and Beat spirit at the above events than in some stuffy folding-chair
auditorium inside NYU.  What the hell does a $140 enrollment fee and
a catered wine-and-cheese reception have to do with Jack Kerouac?  <P>

On the other hand, I've never seen 
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</A>
in person, and since he doesn't show up on the East Coast often 
I hate to miss this 
chance.  But still on the OTHER hand, Lou Reed had originally been 
listed as one of the speakers, and now he's off the list.  Hmmm ...<P>

See you at Biblio's Cafe.  Or maybe I'll just stay home and read.<P>

<H3>May 10, 1995</H3>

1. This is still unconfirmed, but I hear that Brad Pitt and Sean
Penn have been picked for the two lead roles in the new film of
"On The Road."  I'm pretty happy with the choice of Sean Penn, who
I think is an excellent actor.  As for Brad Pitt, I don't really
know his work and couldn't possibly tell him apart from Ethan Hawke
or any of the rest of those guys.  I assume Sean Penn will play
Dean Moriarty, and if that's the case then the film might actually 
work.  Dean (the character based on 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>) 
is the critical role -- all Sal Paradise (the character 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac</A>
based on himself) has to do is sit in the passenger seat looking 
poignant, and I assume Brad Hawke can handle that.<P>

2. A very nice person named
<A HREF="../HomePages/Sherri.html">Sherri</A>
has endeavored to finally create a comprehensive 
<A HREF="../Biblio/SherriBiblio.html">Beat bibliography</A>
for Literary Kicks.  She is now beginning to work on 
author-specific bibliographies, some of which will be
written by other contributors.  Sherri and I would like these
bibliographies to be as complete as possible, so please check the first
one out and send her any info you think she might be missing.<P>

3. There's a fun new radio show dedicated to online culture being
produced in New York, and they were nice enough to call me for a phone
interview this week.  I probably got picked because the guy who runs
the show -- his name is Galinsky -- is a young poet from Brooklyn, and 
Galinsky knows Beats.  The show is called Pseudo Online Radio,
and it's on WEVD 1050 AM on Thursday nights at 11.  Here's their   
logo: <P>

<H3>April 22, 1995</H3>

1. The film version of Jim Carroll's 'Basketball Diaries' is out, and
I would definitely say this classifies as Beat News.  Jim Carroll
is from a later era than the Beats, but Kerouac praised his writing
when Carroll first got published (as a teenager), and his 
sensibility is Beat without a doubt.  However, I recently heard that
the film wasn't that great.  They made it take place in the 90's instead 
of the 60's, for one thing.   <P>

If it turns out that this film sucks (which is what I'm hearing so 
far), there's also 'Crumb,' a documentary about the legendary underground 
comic artist Robert Crumb.  Crumb belongs to the hippie era more than the beat 
era, but he's great, and at least these filmmakers didn't change the 60's to
the 90's.  <P>

2. Allen Ginsberg's journals from the 50's have just been published.
I'll read them after I read the new volume of Kerouac's letters.<P>

<H3>April 6, 1995</H3>

Some announcements: <P>

1.  Allen Ginsberg will be reading his poetry at the Knitting Factory 
in New York for several nights in a row this spring.  He will be 
covering his entire career chronologically, and I believe he will not
read any poem more than once during the series.  Dates are May 4, 5, 
9 and 11, two sets a night.<P>

2. New York University is sponsoring a conference on 'The Writings
of Jack Kerouac' on June 5-6.  Participants include Ginsberg, Ann
Charters, David Amram, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Ed Sanders, Lee
Ranaldo, Diane DiPrima, Gregory Corso and (a new addition to
this crowd) Lou Reed.<P>

3. Visit
<A HREF="http://www.echonyc.com/~mysticfire">Mystic Fire Video</A>
if you're interested in ordering some rare Beat-related videos.  There
are several other kinds of videos available here as well, many with
mystical, literary or alternative-lifestyle themes.<P>

<H3>April 2, 1995</H3>

1. The new Kerouac books (see below) are out.  The Portable Jack 
Kerouac Reader is probably best for the newcomer, as it consists
mainly of excerpts from novels and stories, with a few letters and
other prose pieces.  I still think the best way to discover Kerouac
is just to read
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>,'
but maybe some people will find value in this collection.<P>

The Collected Letters (the first of what will probably be two editions)
looks really fascinating.  I haven't bought it yet, as I've already got 
a huge pile of stuff to read that'll
last me through the spring (I'm reading Ed Sanders' "Tales Of Beatnik 
Glory" right now).  If anybody can send me a good review or summary 
I'll link it in here.<P>

2. Two new plugs: if you want a great catalog of Beat-related books
and videos, send e-mail to waterrow@aol.com with your mailing address
included.  Also, there's a very cool on-paper publication called
RALPH (subtitle: 'Coffee, Jazz & Poetry') which you might want to 
check out.  It's printed on an old Gestetner for that retro appeal,
and it's only four pages long so you don't have to feel guilty about 
all the stuff you don't read.  If you're interested, visit 
<A HREF="http://www.bongobeat.com/">Ralph Alfonso's web page</A>
or send e-mail to ralpha6982@aol.com.<P>

<H3>March 12, 1995</H3>

After months of procrastination, Malcolm Humes has *finally*
made his William S. Burroughs Web site public.  This is
the site I've been telling you about in my Burroughs page
for months.  Malcolm is an experienced Web artist (he also
created the Brian Eno site) and always does good work.  Here's
<A HREF="http://www.hyperreal.com/wsb/">InterNetWebZone</A>.
<P>

<H3>March 6, 1995</H3>

1. Two new Kerouac books will soon be available.  The Portable Jack
Kerouac Reader is edited by Ann Charters, who did an excellent job
with the Portable Beat Reader, and also wrote the first major 
Kerouac biography back in 1973.  A new book of Kerouac's letters
is also coming out, and from what I've heard there's amazing new
stuff in there.  More soon on this.<P>

The Portable Kerouac Reader publication is being kicked off with a
series of readings by Ginsberg, Charters and others.  The New York 
reading will also feature Ed Sanders, Maggie Estep, David Amram,
Richard Hell, Dave Van Ronk and others, and will be held at St.
Mark's Church in the Bowery on March 15.  I'll probably go -- if
you're there and you recognize me from my photos, say hello.  There'll also
be a reading in Lowell; I'm not sure if there'll be others beyond that.
Check your local alternative paper, if you have one.<P>

2.  The 2nd episode of 
<A HREF="http://enterzone.berkeley.edu/enterzone.html">Enterzone</A>
is out, and once again I'm really impressed with the quality of the work 
there.  Enterzone is a hyperfiction multimedia arts project (I think), and
this episode also pays special attention to the Beat phenomenon.  There's a 
a short story of mine in there too (but I'm not just saying I like Enterzone
because I'm in it; I'm in it because I like it). <P>

3. Nate Thompson has created a new Kerouac page 
<A HREF="http://www.lehigh.edu/~nat2/kerouac.html">here</A>.<P>
 
<H3>Feb 27, 1995</H3>

1. Guess what ... Literary Kicks got a mention in the new Bob Dylan
CD-ROM.  <I>COOL !!!</I>.  The CD-ROM, which is called <I>Highway 61
Interactive</I>, has a sort of Myst-like feel, and shows much 
awareness of Dylan's Beat connections (see
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatsInRock.html">here</A>).  
A section called DYLAN@INTERNET lists several Dylan-related Web sites 
as well as mine.  You have to click on the picture of the telephone to see 
this section.  I spent about six hours clicking around on this CD-ROM 
before I discovered that my name was in it.  <P>

2. Some interesting new material on 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
has been surfacing lately.  <I>Newsday</I> (a Long Island/New York newspaper)
published an article about Kerouac's last night in Northport, Long Island
before he moved to St. Petersburg, Florida (where he died).  It turns out
Kerouac's local friends had a minor beer-bash/going-away party for Jack, 
and taped the whole thing.  No real revelations; the tape mostly confirms
other descriptions of Jack's declining years.  He babbles about the past,
yells for people to bring him beer, and ballet-dances around the room to 
the tune of "The Wabash Cannonball."  (Note: if you want to see the article,
it has been posted to rec.music.gdead -- catch it before it disappears.
I have the text but am afraid to link it here.  Newsday probably has
great lawyers).<P>

I also ran into an issue of <I>The Missouri Review</I> (Volume XVII, Number 3)
with Kerouac on the cover and a bunch of previously unpublished letters
from Jack to Ed White (a friend of Jack's from 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia</A>, 
who turned up as Ed Gray in 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>'.) <P>

3. To those of you who have sent me material that hasn't shown up yet -- I 
haven't forgotten, I'm just very busy.  I'm working on a new Web site, a 
fiction/art project, which I'll be announcing here soon.  After I finish this
other site I'll start devoting all my attention to LitKicks again, and growing
it much faster.  <P>

Also, I wish I had more time to shape up my bibliographies and expand into 
other areas.  If anybody out there would like to become a part of this
project and take over an area of specialty, I'd like to hear from you.
It'd be nice, for instance, if I had an official Kerouac Bibliographer,
a Burroughs Film Indexer, a Ginsberg Activities Chronicler, a Kesey expert,
etc.  Send me mail if you're interested!<P>

4. Lots of news on the upcoming 'On The Road' film.  I went to a casting
call -- read about it 
<A HREF="../Topics/CattleCall.html">here</A>.<P>

<H3>Jan 28, 1995</H3>

1.  According to <I>New York</I> Magazine, there will be an open casting
call for the main parts in the Coppola film of 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>'
on February 4 at the St. Paul the Apostle Auditorium near Columbus
Circle in NY.  Will I be there?  HELL YEAH!!! Not looking to get 
a part; I'll just go to hang around and soak in the scene.<P>

I seem to be contradicting my own rumors about this film constantly on 
this page.  I think I'll just create a new "Road Film Rumors page" soon
and put all my misinformation there.  The latest rumor, from the same <I>New 
York</I> magazine article: the film may not happen at all, but if it does 
it will be Coppola directing, not Gus Van Sant (good!).  The screenplay is by 
Coppola and Michael Herr, who wrote the acclaimed Vietnam novel 'Dispatches' 
and also worked on Coppola's film 'Apocalypse Now.'<P>

2. Here's a brief, interesting
<A HREF="http://www.execpc.com/~ppf">poetry page</A>.  There's a cool Jack 
Kerouac quote in it (you see how easy it is it to earn a link from me).<P>
 
<H3>Jan 14, 1995</H3>

Lotsa news to catch up on:<P>

1. More rumors about the Coppola film of 'On The Road.'  First of all,
supposedly Coppola will only be producing, and Gus Van Sant may be
directing.  I'm not crazy about this idea: Van Sant's film
'<A HREF="../Films/DrugstoreCowboy.html">Drugstore Cowboy</A>'
was pretty good, but I wouldn't call it great, and he's also the 
director who screwed up the film version of 'Even Cowgirls Get The
Blues.'  Van Sant has a relationship with William S. Burroughs, but I don't
consider that any kind of indication that he can inhabit a Kerouac 
state of mind.  Kerouac has a sad, sentimental side ... I'd rather see
Coppola direct this film himself.<P>

And what's this shit about Bruce Willis playing one of the leads?  God, I
hope this is just a bad rumor.  More on the casting of this below ... <P>

2. The British playwright John Osborne has died.  He was one of England's
'Angry Young Men' in the fifties, and became famous for his first play, 
'Look Back In Anger,' around the same time that 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>'s 
'On The Road' was published in America.  The Angry Young Men were
Britain's version of the 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A>. 
They represented the same sort of challenge to the literary complacency
of their time, and like the Beats generated a tremendous amount of 
excitement and controversy.  Osborne is not very well known in America these
days, but he's written many well known plays and film scripts, including 
'Luther,' 'The Entertainer' (starring Laurence Olivier) and an adaptation
of 'Tom Jones.'  I'm hoping to write more on the Angry Young Men (and the
French equivalents, the Existentialists of the 40's and '50's) when I get 
some time.<P>

3. William S. Burroughs' new book, 'My Education,' has been published.
The New York Times gave it a decent review, though it said 
the lack of a plot makes it more suited for skimming than reading.  
A Burroughs article also appears in the newest issue of Grand Street.  Will
somebody please create a Burroughs Web site so I can stop trying to keep
up with the activities of this prolific octogenarian?  I'm trying, but my
main focus here is on Kerouac and Ginsberg and the whole Beat Vision, and I
think Burroughs' vision is a separate thing (though he hung out with the Beats 
and shared many of their insights) and deserves a Web site of it's own.<P>

4. There are two new Beat resources on the Net: alt.books.beatgeneration has 
been created (the reason 'beatgeneration' is not hyphenated, in case you're 
wondering, is that there is a fourteen-character limit on Usenet names.)
Also, Michael Hayward (Michael_Hayward@sfu.ca) has put an interesting and 
well-researched paper on the history of Beat publishing up on the Web.  You
can reach it
<A HREF="http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/UnspeakableVisions/page1.html">here</A>.<P>
