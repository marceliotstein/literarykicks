<H3>INTRODUCTION (First Draft!)</H3>

There's a theory among neurological scientists that poetry is actually the native form of brain activity. Our minds are wired for rhyme and meter. Non-poetic, linear, rational thinking, according to this theory, was a later development in the evolutionary path. <BR><BR>

This theory is supported by archeological evidence. The earliest extant forms of writings are in verse, from Gilgamesh to the Mahabharata to Homer to Ecclesiastes. Flat prose is not found until later historical periods. <BR><BR>

The primacy of poetry as a natural form of brain activity also makes sense from a functional point of view. Rhythm and phrasing and tonal coloring endow thoughts with pleasurable sensory connotations, allowing them to glide smoothly through neural pathways. Consider the fact that your brain can store the lyrics to hundreds of songs, while you probably couldn't memorize three paragraphs of Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" without tremendous effort. <BR><BR>

But there are some alarming consequences to the realization that our brains are organically wired for poetry, For instance, the theory implies that less evolved animal forms must be *still* thinking in poetry. Your dog or cat is sitting there right now composing free verse. <BR><BR>

Even more disturbingly, this theory suggests that you've written a lot of poems in your life that you don't even remember. You wrote one when you went to sleep last night. You wrote one when you woke up this morning. You probably forgot some damn good poems. <BR><BR>

The idea of literature as the organic form of thought forms the basis of Action Poetry. Action Poetry represents the idea that poetic awareness is all around us. It permeates our lives like water permeates a sponge. Turn off your cellphone for a minute. Stop thinking, walking, talking and doing whatever else it is that you do. Close your eyes and listen to what you hear. There is a poetry slam going on in your brain right now, if you listen hard enough. <BR><BR>

In the real world, "Action Poetry" is the name of a message board on the LitKicks.com website where thousands of poets write original works and respond to each other's writings with either critique or complementary verses. The LitKicks community, representing every age group, cultural background and level of education in the world, is the basis of this book. Many of the poems and prose pieces featured here originated on the "Action Poetry" board or elsewhere on the LitKicks site. <BR><BR>

But this book is not meant to be rooted in a single internet community. We are interested in how poetry and literature work within the context of the everyday lives of people all over the world. Our experience as the hosts of LitKicks.com has given us a unique vantage point from which to observe the meaning of literary inspiration in the lives of an incredible variety of human souls. This book is not only a collection of original writings, but also a study of how people use literature in their everyday lives. The writers who inspire you may form a large part of your own self-image, and your understanding of your place in the world. The dynamic sense of literature as a functional part of human life is what we most wish to capture in this book. <BR><BR>

We've subtitled this book "Literary Tribes of the Internet Age" because there is no other way to capture the breadth and scope of today's literary scene. Modern poetry and fiction cannot be understood by reading the New York Times bestseller list or visiting Barnes & Noble. The heart of the literary scene has never been anything but underground, invisible, hard to find -- and this book is an attempt at a map. <BR><BR>

Chapbook poets who painstakingly bind their creations with needle and thread, spoken word artists who live for their five minutes of glory every week at the local coffee bar, experimental novelists who construct elaborate worlds of private significance in the hope that somebody besides themselves will ever enter these world ... these are the people who form the alternative literary sensibility of our age. A tiny few of them will eventually become famous, and many more will not. But every one of them is unique, and this book is for anybody who ever read a poem or a story and thought "I want to write my own". That is the truest and best way to experience literature -- not with passivity but with action. <BR><BR>

We hope this book represents a new way to think about literature, and what it means to all of us in our regular lives. We also hope you'll have fun reading it. Thanks to ... (THANK YOU's GO HERE)<BR>
