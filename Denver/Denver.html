In the winter of 1995, only two blocks remain of the 
<A HREF="Larimer.html">Larimer Street</A>
Neal Cassady knew. For forty years Larimer used to stretch as one long
skid-row for most of its 25-block length, but today only two true skid-row
blocks remain, between 20th and 22nd: bars that open at eight in the morning
(signs say "No children after 5:00"); pawn shops where Cassady very likely
pawned anything he could get his hands on for quick cash; a 12-step recovery
shelter, three bars, two liquor stores, a barber shop, and a Mexican bakery.
At most, maybe three men are unconscious now on any given morning, where
once there'd have been fifteen or twenty (gentrification has moved the shelters
almost ten blocks north).  Instead of Larimer, the men wait for the sun
to come up at 23rd and Curtis.<P>

This last two-block stretch of semi-decrepit Larimer will probably be gone
by the winter of '97 -- young architects are already living on the second
floors of boarded-up buildings while they supervise ground-level renovation
projects below.  The brand-new baseball stadium is half a block away (Cassady
would have loved this, though); young hipsters gather every Wednesday night
at Herb's Hideout to do their retro lounge gig with big-city martinis; and
even La Popular, the bakery that fills Larimer with the smell of pan dulce
at dawn, is about to move over to Lawrence -- the rents are going up; the
old owners are getting the hell out and making major bucks in the process.
If you read this as your last chance to see Denver as Cassady even remotely saw
it, you're right: it's your last chance. That only a year or two remains of
this isn't good or bad, but semi-holy moments here are dwindling: one night
in seven the owner of the almost-abandoned Western Hotel accidentally leaves
the neon sign on at 21st and Larimer and the blurry old blue-orange of
Western matches the blue-orange of the morning sky. And again, there's
really no accounting for how good the fresh Mexican sweet bread smells on a
dark winter morning -- if the wind's just right, it wraps all the way around
you while you're still three blocks away.<P>

Denver isn't much but it'll do. It's a fact that American cities are
increasingly homogeneous: shopping malls horrify in the same way in Newark
as they do in Phoenix; inner cities are run down and then gentrified in the
same ways everywhere. If a Beat site remains in Denver it's only because it
was ignored from the end of World War II into the nineties: over fifty years
of being so useless that no one even cared to tear it down. And for the most
part if there's any change at all in a Denver Beat site, it's because the
building was so worthless and damaged that it was worth more flattened than
intact.<P>

It's hard to write about Denver and the Beats without persisting in a little
city-wide anti-karmic self-justification. New York and San Francisco are
true, hardcore beat sites -- anything about Denver is going to sound as if
somebody, somewhere is protesting just a little too much about a provincial
capital with only peripheral links to Beat authors.<P>

It's hard, too, to write about Neal Cassady. He-man mercenary, neo-Proustian
speed freak, devil incarnate, lost angel, part hipster, part huckster, half
lost, half found, he's not an easy fit for the sort of molto-pc puritan
categories that our very proper fin de siecle comes up with. Some of what he
did and said was beautiful; and some of it was repellent. Anyone conned by
Neal Cassady has one story to tell; anyone who truly loved him tells
another. Only Carolyn Cassady and Allen Ginsberg among all the commentators
have brought together Neal's two halves to create something resembling a
clear picture (Everyone else loves him or hates him unduly -- resulting in a
cartoonish Cassady representing either beatitude or evil-doing). It's clear
enough that love for Neal -- loving him in spite of himself as only a
life-partner could -- is the quality that both his widow and Ginsberg share. 
And even then, Carolyn Cassady's "Off the Road" is the best document we have 
at present for grasping at the life of the man.<P>

He's our Rimbaud without the luck Rimbaud had -- and R. didn't have too
much. He's an American R. behind the wheel of one of our century's
automobiles going way too fast down one of our streets. Close to a crew-cut,
handsome as hell, jeans and a t-shirt, he's got our drugs, our music, our
idiom and our books. If he's a monster, he's a monster of our making; if
he's a new type of earthly saint, well then we've done this, too. There are
moments near the end when Cassady himself describes nothing but blankness
(man, does this remind me of Rimbaud in Abyssinia -- isn't it appropriate that
the American Rimbaud's Abyssinia was Los Gatos, California, working on the
railroad and recapping tires?).  Listen to Cassady speed rap on one of the Acid
Test tapes from '65 and all you hear is the void -- but it's an American
void, and anyone with a brain and an ounce of lostness knows the void as
theirs. He was Kerouac's hero but he's our anti-hero: you can't be a hero
and have as much trouble with the planet as he did.<P>

Money, shoes, pants, knowledge, whatever: it's a fair bet that if Cassady
approached you on the street near the end of the millennium, he'd charm or
con something off you in a heartbeat. (Don't we all attempt to do this in
one way or another? At one level or another?) Since Cassady lived so
thoroughly in his now, he was at the center of the universe (or his part of
it) all the time -- and it's my guess that those who knew him and loved him
were seduced by how vivid he was; how vivid his now was. Larimer (or Van
Ness, or 116th Street) with Cassady was probably a pretty damned vivid, live
and exciting place.<P>

Cassady's universal poor-boy boyhood occurred in downtown Denver within a
four-mile circle. Cassady's boyhood could have occurred anywhere, I think,
but it happens that Denver produced him. There's a mystique because of this:
there's a web site in Pasadena for a group of twentysomething friends who
decided to take a spring break road trip to Denver last spring. Their
schedule left them with maybe six waking hours here but still they wanted to
make the trip. Buried in their hypertext links was a reference to "On The
Road," and it was clear that this book was the source of their desire to see
Denver. It's my guess that, via Kerouac, thousands of readers have felt the
urge to explore Denver as Sal Paradise did; and search for Dean Moriarty as
Sal did.<P>

Literary Kicks curator Levi Asher talked about a mystique, too, in his
original Denver page ("I've never been to Denver, but I'm dying to go. I'd
get drunk on Tokay at a Larimer Street dive, and then go street-crawling in
search of Dean Moriarty's forever-lost father."), and he encouraged this 
informal exploration after my e-mail thanked him for his work, especially
his half page of Denver-centered dreams. Anyone growing up in provincial,
suburban America would understand this: you grow up on the periphery
dreaming of life elsewhere -- life at the center of things -- and decades
later you end up a little bit in love with the streets where all the
dream-manufacturing took place. Nowheresville. This is where everybody grows
up; this is where everybody flees from. Denver is nowheresville. Kerouac had
Lowell; Ginsberg had Patterson; Cassady had Denver. I know the feeling:
Denver's mine whether I want it or not.<P>

Growing up in Denver, I always enjoyed having little secret Beat bits of
knowledge to myself: ten years ago I'd eat lunch leaning against the Water
Department building in Civic Center knowing that this was the Carnegie
public library when Neal Cassady was jailbait pure and simple, in and out of
juvy hall-- devouring Kant and Schopenhauer when he wasn't stealing cars and
attempting to put the nth line over on the nth girl. This library was
secondary in importance, though, to the little library inside Ebert
Elementary at the corner of Park Avenue West (a downright fabulous name for
run-down 23rd Street) and Glenarm. This was where Cassady's boyhood was
transformed by an obsession with Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. This was
library number one for me, too, because my mother went to kindergarten and
first grade here (just as Cassady had ten years earlier) in '45 and '46. As
a guilt-ridden, past-haunted newsroom manager, I'd volunteered at the
after-school program at Ebert for my mother's memory long before I ever knew
that Cassady had been a book-devouring child in the same Cristo-filled
library. The demographics of this neighborhood haven't changed in fifty
years: I realized that I was reading stories to modern little manic,
multi-colored, post-Ritalin Neals, pinching and kicking their way to
enlightenment.<P>

Just so you get an idea of the linkages: I couldn't for a moment pretend
that these weren't personal links to Cassady; or personal links to Denver.
This is compounded by my boyhood here, my periodic jailbaitness, the
recognition of my own huckster quotient, and my father's frail, lifelong
barberness. There's nothing I can do about either; neither could Neal.<P>

Okay, and one more level of connection: Cassady grew up in Denver's Curtis
Park neighborhood, and a year and a half ago, at a down-and-out moment, I
was charmed by the neighborhood's down-and-outness, and I found myself iving
in a funky mustard yellow Victorian stucco mansion built in 1884 (Rimbaud
was running guns in Abyssinia; Emily Dickenson was holed up in her upstairs
room in Amherst; Henry James was writing letters from London; Kafka was a
baby), one empty lot away from the northwestern corner of 26th and Champa. I
found my old 1971 copy of the slimmer, less-complete City Lights edition of
The First Third (what other publishing house would touch it? Bless you,
Larry Ferlinghetti) and was blown away to discover that page after page of
Cassady's autobiography dealt with this very block. Between loving Denver
and Cassady in spite of myself, this exploration has been the perfect
mini-adventure for a dry western winter.<P>

The Beats themselves, Ann Charters, Gerald Nicosia and other consummate Beat
biographers and researchers have already nailed down the traditional linear
history of the Beats, so perhaps a non-linear mini-Michelin guide to
Denver's beat sites might complement their important work.<P>

The best work of all about Denver and the Beats are the central texts:
Cassady's "The First Third," Kerouac's "On the Road" and "Visions of Cody,"
Ginsberg's "The Great Rememberer." Buy them, come to Denver, walk these streets,
get at American ghosts.<P>
