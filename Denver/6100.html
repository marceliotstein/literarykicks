``I'm going to Colorado in June. My family & I are ready to move out there
if we can find an abode. I am extremely weary of New York--there is no
mystery left in it for me.''<br>
 [Jack Kerouac to Allan Harrington, April 23,1949. Letters, p. 188]<p>

``I have spent my entire one thousand dollars in this huge madness...I am
doing a lot of writing however...'' [Jack Kerouac to John Clellon Holmes,
June 24, 1949. Letters, p. 196]<p>

``...I suddenly took off from New York. This was only a swift decision on an
old idea I had, to establish some kind of ``homestead'' for myself and
family -- an idea I had been harboring for years...I suddenly packed one
night and went, and prayed on the bus that I might have luck in Denver
finding a house and all such matters...The whole idea has really
collapsed.''<br>
 [Jack Kerouac to Elbert Lenrow, June 28, 1949. Letters, p. 201]<p>

``No more letters to 6100 W. Center. See you in N.Y. in 2 weeks.''<br>
 [Jack Kerouac to Allen Ginsberg, July 26, 1949. Letters, p. 210]<p>

``...just an hour ago I was standing in my yard looking at the great heat
lightning over the plains, and to the west over the mountains...I had a
desire to go in both directions at the same time.'' <br>
[Jack Kerouac to Neal Cassady, July 28, 1949. Letters, p. 211]<P>

``"I'm too cold--<BR>
I wanta go to Golden,<BR>
That's my home.``<BR>
