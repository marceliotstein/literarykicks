``On The Bakery's left, toward 25th Street, was my first ``Haunted House''
though it comes to mind better as the scene of an early sex experience...''
[First  Third p. 97]<p>

``Finally, in the last month of this hectic year [1930], Neal [Sr.] got a
two-chair shop near the corner of 26th and Champa Streets. In this sad
little shop so filled with contention, Neal and Maude shared the last year
of their pitiful marriage.'' [First Third, p. 45]<p>

``Neal's non-sobriety persisted as did the dwindling of customers, so that
they just couldn't make ends meet, and Neal lost the shop, the last of
several, early in 1932. He also lost his wife...Little Neal went with his
wino father into the lowest slums of Denver.''<p>
