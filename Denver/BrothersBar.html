<h3>Letter Found in My Brother's Bar</h3><br>
</center>
     
This fragment of a letter was found on the wall at My Brother's Bar
and transcribed it here with permission of
the bar's owner.  As the explanation that follows the letter 
says: Justin Brierly was an older friend and
supporter of the young Neal Cassady who tried to help him cast
aside his criminal tendencies by introducing him to a "better
crowd" in Denver.  This led to Neal's visit to 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>
where he met Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg for the first
time.  Justin Brierly appears in "On The Road" as the
(slightly ridiculous) Denver B. Doll.<P>

Dear Justin<P>
     
        At the corner of 15th & Platte streets there's a cafe called Paul's 
     Place, where my brother Jack used to be bartender before he joined the 
     army, because of this I frequented the place occasionally & 
     consequently have a small bill run up, I believe I owe them about 3 or 
     4 dollars. If you happen to be in that vicinity please drop in & pay 
     it, will you?<P>
     
        I see Phillip Wylie has written another book, "Night Unto Night" 
     supposedly as good as "Generation of Vipers".  Peter Arno also has a 
     new collection of cartoons out, "Man in a shower" its called.<P>
     
        They have the Harvard Classics up here, the five foot shelf of 
     books, I've read about 2 feet of it, very nice, I especially enjoy 
     (over)<P>

     Warden, Ed Lindsley"</I><P>
     
     COMMENTARY ON FACING PAGE:<P>
     
     "I first met Dean...when he was a young jailkid shrouded in 
     mystery", begins Sal Paradise in ON THE ROAD.  "First reports of him 
     come to me through Chad King, who'd shown me a few letters from him 
     written in a New Mexico reform school."  Chad King & Neal Cassady 
     were Denver friends introduced by their mutual counselor Justin 
     Brierly, a lawyer on the Denver schoolboard concerned with students of 
     both persuasions -- the college-bound & the truant.  He had been the 
     "old professor" to Neal since their first encounter when Neal was 
     16, in 1941.  The letters to King & Brierly were written while Cassady 
     was serving a 10-month term at Colorado State Reformatory in Buena 
     Vista (the "New Mexico reform school"), in 1944-45.<P>
     
     The letter reproduced here shows Neal at his most subtle, conning 
     best.  It initiated an exchange between Brierly & the warden, replying 
     thanks, but no thanks.  Cassady's next letter is a succinct, 
     trenchant, between-the-lines censure of Brierly for not accomplishing 
     this secret desire.  "Thanks a lot for writing to the warden, however 
     we have had a new warden (Thomas) since july, I'm rather disappointed 
     to note that you, a man of the world, had failed to read in the 
     newspaper that Ed Lindsley died in an auto accident three weeks ago, I 
     know full well you must have purposely overlooked the article, because 
     of the unimportance of the death of an ex-warden of a reformatory."
     He then takes a swipe at the "petty attitudes" of the guards, 
     meanwhile handing out a plaudit to the institution as a whole, 
     commenting that while it is "hard to be fair with everybody" most 
     officials are quite just in their dealings w/the inmates, so that 
     "consequently I find it rather easy to accept with philosophical calm 
     the winds of dispute that swirl around this piece."<P>
     
     But Neal's fit didn't last long & later as a member of the basketball 
     team he did get days away from the reformatory to play against teams 
     of the neighboring towns.  He never expressed any severe dislike with
     his sentencing, even writing once of his pride in how successfully he had 
     "become adjusted to reformatory life."  There was much in his 
     letters about the winning & losing of points, a certain number of 
     which wd entitle him to an early release.  His duties were light.  
     Soon after arriving he was transferred from the work gangs to the 
     dairy farm where he stayed for four months until reduced to 
     "shoveling sheep manure for my keep" as punishment for "hitting a 
     cow" & losing points in the bargain.  That lasted only long enough for 
     Cassady to somehow be awarded the best scam possible, Office Boy.  In 
     a letter scrutinizing his friendship w/Brierly, Neal notes their 
     differing attitudes: "already I have a tendency to be intolerant of 
     society, at least its general opinions, which to you, because of your 
     occupation, is quite important."  He characterizes another person 
     as "Brilliant woman Mrs. O'Sullivan, except, of course, for her 
     nauseating Christianity, however, that's probably a necessity (in one 
     form or another) for all otherwise intelligent females."  He explains 
     a lapse in letter-writing in true fashion: "I failed to write to 
     you...because I had to write to a girl who (I presume) was naive 
     enough to wire me asking if I wished her to come, what made her 
     telegraph incriminating was that I was in a position to see her 
     illegally and the warden suspected I had written her asking if she 
     would come and - well - see me, consequently I wrote to her that week 
     requesting an explanation."  Another lapse was due to a letter from 
     his father, requiring an immediate answer.  Other family matters were 
     his youngest sister Shirley's graduation from the 8th grade & 
     subsequent release from the orphanage where she had been since she was 
     eight years old.  Neal writes of the possibility of his obtaining 
     custody or perhaps having her adopted by friends, "working on several 
     angles.  Things are moving.  I'll be 19 Feb. 8th."<P>
     
     Until one day, "Then news came that Dean was out of reform school and 
     was coming to New York for the first time..." continues Paradise.  Of 
     their meeting he writes, "My first impression of Dean was of a young 
     Gene Autry -- trim, thin-hipped, blue-eyed, with a real Oklahoma 
     accent - a sideburned hero of the snowy West."<P></I></BLOCKQUOTE>
