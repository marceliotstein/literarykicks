``Then we entered the modern building of gleaming white firebrick that is<br>
Ebert Grammar School...So, in defiance of Denver's geography, I went to<br>
Ebert six straight years. And this was no mean foot-feat: I always lived at<br>
least a mile from the school, and often more even as many as four. In fact,<br>
it was the many mornings of racing these miles (since I seldom had carfare<br>
or would use it if I had) so as not to be late, that must have led to my<br>
becoming so interested in long-distance running.'' [First Third, p. 53]
