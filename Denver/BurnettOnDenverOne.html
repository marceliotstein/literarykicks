Denver, Neal and the Beats

A Personal Exploration, a Beat Baedeker

In the winter of 1995, only two blocks remain of the Larimer Street that
Neal Cassady knew. For forty years Larimer used to stretch as one long
skid-row for most of its 25-block length, but today only two true skid-row
blocks remain, between 20th and 22nd: Bars that open at eight in the morning
(signs say "No children after 5:00"); pawn shops where Cassady very likely
pawned anything he could get his hands on for quick cash; a 12-step recovery
shelter, three bars, two liquor stores, a barber shop, and a Mexican bakery.
At most, maybe three men are unconscious here on any given morning now where
once there'd be fifteen or twenty (gentrification has moved the shelters
almost ten blocks north); and instead of Larimer, the men wait for the sun
to come up at 23rd and Curtis now.

This last two-block stretch of semi-decrepit Larimer will probably be gone
by the winter of '97 -- young architects are already living on the second
floors of boarded-up buildings while they supervise round-level renovation
projects below; the brand-new baseball stadium is half a block away (Cassady
would have loved this, though); young hipsters gather every Wednesday night
at Herb's Hideout to do their retro lounge gig with big-city martinis; and
even La Popular, the bakery that fills Larimer with the smell of pan dulce
at dawn, is about to move over to Lawrence -- the rents are going up; the
old owners are getting the hell out and making major bucks in the process.
If you read this as your last chance to see it as Cassady even remotely saw
it, you're right: It's your last chance. That only a year or two remains of
this isn't good or bad, but semi-holy moments here are dwindling: One night
in seven the owner of the almost-abandoned Western Hotel accidentally leaves
the neon sign on at 21st and Larimer and the blurry old blue-orange of
Western matches the blue-orange of the morning sky. And again, there's
really no accounting for how good the fresh Mexican sweet bread smells on a
dark winter morning -- if the wind's just right, it wraps all the way around
you while you're still three blocks away.

Denver isn't much but it'll do. It's a fact that American cities are
increasingly homogeneous: shopping malls horrify in the same way in Newark
as they do in Phoenix; inner cities are run down and then gentrified in the
same ways everywhere. If a Beat site remains in Denver it's only because it
was ignored from the end of World War II into the nineties: over fifty years
of being so useless that no one even cared to tear it down. And for the most
part if there's any change at all in a Denver Beat site, it's because the
building was so worthless and damaged that it was worth more flattened than
intact.

It's hard to write about Denver and the Beats without persisting in a little
city-wide anti-karmic self-justification. New York and San Francisco are
true, hardcore beat sites -- anything about Denver is going to sound as if
somebody, somewhere is protesting just a little too much about a provincial
capital with only peripheral links to Beat authors.

It's hard, too, to write about Neal Cassady. He-man mercenary, neo-Proustian
speed freak, devil incarnate, lost angel, part hipster, part huckster, half
lost, half found, he's not an easy fit for the sort of molto-pc neo-puritan
categories that our very proper fin de siecle comes up with. Some of what he
did and said was beautiful; and some of it was repellent. Anyone conned by
Neal Cassady has one story to tell; anyone who truly loved him tells
another. Only Carolyn Cassady and Allen Ginsberg among all the commentators
have brought together Neal's two halves to create something resembling a
clear picture (Everyone else loves him or hates him unduly -- resulting in a
cartoonish Cassady representing either beatitude or evil-doing). It's clear
enough that love for Neal -- loving him in spite of himself as only a
life-partner could -- is the quality that both CC and AG share. And even
then, CC's Off the Road is the best document we have at present for grasping
at the life of the man.

He's our Rimbaud without the luck Rimbaud had -- and R. didn't have too
much. He's an American R. behind the wheel of one of our century's
automobiles going way too fast down one of our streets. Close to a crew-cut,
handsome as hell, jeans and a t-shirt, he's got our drugs, our music, our
idiom and our books. If he's a monster, he's a monster of our making; if
he's a new type of earthly saint, well then we've done this, too. There are
moments near the end when Cassady himself describes nothing but blankness
(man, does this remind me of R. in Abyssinia -- isn't it appropriate that
the American Rimbaud's Abyssinia was Los Gatos, California, working on the
railroad and capping tires?); listen to Cassady speed rap on one of the Acid
Test tapes from '65 and all you hear is the void -- but it's an American
void, and anyone with a brain and an ounce of lostness knows the void as
theirs. He was Kerouac's hero but he's our anti-hero: you can't be a hero
and have as much trouble with the planet as he did.

Money, shoes, pants, knowledge, whatever: It's a fair bet that if Cassady
approached you on the street near the end of the millennium, he'd charm or
con something off you in a heartbeat. (Don't we all attempt to do this in
one way or another? At one level or another?) Since Cassady lived so
thoroughly in his now, he was at the center of the universe (or his part of
it) all the time -- and it's my guess that those who knew him and loved him
were seduced by how vivid he was; how vivid his now was. Larimer (or Van
Ness, or 116th Street) with Cassady was probably a pretty damned vivid, live
and exciting place.

Cassady's universal poor boy boyhood occurred in downtown Denver within a
four-mile circle. Cassady's boyhood could have occurred anywhere, I think,
but it happens that Denver produced him. There's a mystique because of this:
There's a web site in Pasadena for a group of twentysomething friends who
decided to take a spring break road trip to Denver last spring. Their
schedule left them with maybe six waking hours here but still they wanted to
make the trip. Buried in their hypertext links was a reference to On The
Road, and it was clear that OTR was the source of their desire to see
Denver. It's my guess that, via Kerouac, thousands of readers have felt the
urge to explore Denver as Sal Paradise did; and search for Dean Moriarty as
Sal did.

Brooklyn's Beat avatar Levi Asher talked about a mystique, too, in his
original Denver page ("I've never been to Denver, but I'm dying to go. I'd
get drunk on Tokay at a Larimer Street dive, and then go street-crawling in
search of Dean Moriarty's forever-lost father."), and he, along with
LitKicks' grand Beat bibliographer Sherri Hoffman, encouraged this informal
exploration after my e-mail thanked them for their work-- especially for
Levi's half page of Denver-centered dreams. Anyone growing up in provincial,
suburban America would understand this: you grow up on the periphery
dreaming of life elsewhere -- life at the center of things -- and decades
later you end up a little bit in love with the streets where all the
dream-manufacturing took place. Nowheresville. This is where everybody grows
up; this is where everybody flees from. Denver is nowheresville. Kerouac had
Lowell; Ginsberg had Patterson; Cassady had Denver. I know the feeling:
Denver's mine whether I want it or not.

Growing up in Denver, I always enjoyed having little secret Beat bits of
knowledge to myself: ten years ago I'd eat lunch leaning against the Water
Department building in Civic Center knowing that this was the Carnegie
public library when Neal Cassady was jailbait pure and simple, in and out of
juvy hall-- devouring Kant and Schopenhauer when he wasn't stealing cars and
attempting to put the nth line over on the nth girl. This library was
secondary in importance, though, to the little library inside Ebert
Elementary at the corner of Park Avenue West (a downright fabulous name for
run-down 23rd Street) and Glenarm. This was where Cassady's boyhood was
transformed by an obsession with Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. This was
library number one for me, too, because my mother went to kindergarten and
first grade here (just as Cassady had ten years earlier) in '45 and '46. As
a guilt-ridden, past-haunted newsroom manager, I'd volunteered at the
after-school program at Ebert for my mother's memory long before I ever knew
that Cassady had been a book-devouring child in the same Cristo-ridden
library. The demographics of this neighborhood haven't changed in fifty
years: I realized that I was reading stories to modern little manic,
multi-colored, post-Ritalin Neals, pinching and kicking their way to
enlightenment.

Just so you get an idea of the linkages: I couldn't for a moment pretend
that these weren't personal links to Cassady; or personal links to Denver.
This is compounded by my boyhood here, my periodic jailbaitness, the
recognition of my own huckster quotient, and my father's frail, lifelong
barberness. There's nothing I can do about either; neither could Neal.

Okay, and one more level of connection: Cassady grew up in Denver's Curtis
Park neighborhood, and a year and a half ago, at a down-and-out moment, I
was charmed by the neighborhood's down-and-outness, and I found myself iving
in a funky mustard yellow Victorian stucco mansion built in 1884 (Rimbaud
was running guns in Abyssinia; Emily Dickenson was holed up in her upstairs
room in Amherst; Henry James was writing letters from London; Kafka was a
baby), one empty lot away from the northwestern corner of 26th and Champa. I
found my old 1971 copy of the slimmer, less-complete City Lights edition of
The First Third (what other publishing house would touch it? Bless you,
Larry Ferlinghetti) and was blown away to discover that page after page of
Cassady's autobiography dealt with this very block. Between loving Denver
and Cassady in spite of myself, this exploration has been the perfect
mini-adventure for a dry western winter.

The Beats themselves, Ann Charters, Gerald Nicosia and other consummate Beat
biographers and researchers have already nailed down the traditional linear
history of the Beats, so perhaps a non-linear mini-Michelin guide to
Denver's beat sites might complement their important work.

The best work of all about Denver and the Beats are the central texts:
Cassady's The First Third, Kerouac's On the Road and Visions of Cody,
Ginsberg's The Great Remember. Buy them, come to Denver, walk these streets,
get at American ghosts.

The Bona Fide Beat Train

Denverites don't know it, but there's a bona fide Beat train that stops at
the corner of 16th & California downtown. (Hey, eat before you head north:
50 yards north of the stop is Vietnamna, where the lemongrass beef rice
noodle bowl is fast, cheap and supreme; or right at the stop is Anthony's
NY-style pizza (it's poyfect)). While you're standing there trying to fold
the slice for proper mouth entry, look across the street -- you're looking
at the old Denver Dry building, where the Denver Dry Goods Company was the
prime department store for years. Two months after The Town and the City was
published, Jack Kerouac did a book signing in here in May, 1950, before
heading down to Mexico. The photograph on page 52 of Barry Gifford and
Lawrence Lee's Jack's Book was taken at the signing by Justin Brierly, who
through the years was Neal Cassady's mentor. For at least the last ten years
of its existence, The Denver Dry Goods book department was in the basement
of the building where, appropriately enough, there's still a book store. So
as you wander downstairs in Media Play's book department, you're probably
standing where Kerouac did one of his first (and rare) book signings.

It's time to finish your pizza and quit gawking at the building across the
street so you can get on the train (Important: watch for the one that says
"30th and Downing"). The train will head straight north for two and half
blocks before making its first right turn on 19th Street. Look out the left
window and you'll see Holy Ghost Church, where Neal Cassady was baptized in
1936 and spent three years as an altar boy. Starting here, you're also
following, almost exactly, Neal's route to his elementary school as he
documents it in The First Third. As the train turns left, look quickly to
your right. The intersection of 20th and Court Place doesn't exist anymore
but if it did, it'd be there: Neal and his family lived here briefly in 1930
when Neal was four. It's not an entirely a non-Beat moment, but you're also
looking at the corner of 20th and Lincoln: At age 18, just months after
graduating from high school in Minnesota, Bob Dylan played here in the late
summer or fall of 1959, at the Exodus Gallery Bar, at 1999 Lincoln -- the
building stands but it's not likely to stand much longer. He stayed in
Denver for only a few weeks before trying a semester at the University of
Minnesota and then moving on to New York City in early 1960. He was a full
year away from anything even approaching fame. It's not unreasonable to
interpret Dylan's arrival in Denver as a reaction to reading On The Road --
of all the cities Dylan could have moved to in 1959 -- Denver's folk scene
was no more amazing than any other midwestern city -- he chose Denver.

As you move onto Welton, the Denverites on the train will think you're nuts
for jumping from side to side, but between 22nd and 23rd you'll want to be
on the right side of the train. Over vacant lots you'll be able to see the
playground of Ebert Elementary (410 West Park Avenue), where Neal Cassady
went to school for five years. It was in Ebert's library that Neal went
again and again for a copy of The Count of Monte Cristo and began to devour
books. As you glimpse 23rd street, look over at the boarded-up storefronts
and a funky little sky-blue boarded-up shop. This is where Cassady's family
first lived in 1928 when coming to Denver -- part barber shop, part shoe
repair shop, with way too many Cassadys living in way too little space. Look
down 23rd Street (Park Avenue West, now) as you cross and you'll see the
front of Ebert Elementary.

Okay, quickly now, look left at the baseball field (23rd and Welton) -- if
it's early evening, chances are that there's a game in progress, but this is
the field Kerouac wrote about in On The Road; and Cassady walked through
this ield every day on his way to school when he stayed with his mother.
Kerouac watched a baseball game one night here at age 27 in the summer of
1949 during his solitary search for Dean Moriarty, taking essential notes
for OTR. Considering all his years as a boy in this neighborhood, it's
probable that Cassady played many baseball games on this field.

As you cross 24th Street you enter Denver's Five Points district, where
Kerouac came chasing Cassady and Cassady came chasing jazz. On your left
you'll see The Roxy and The Casino, and on your right at 27th (the
five-corner ground zero spot) you'll see the famous Rossonian, now empty and
waiting for new life (last summer Andy Garcia, James Caan and Treat Williams
shot parts of Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (thanks, Mr. Zevon) in
the Rossonian, and at 27th & Welton)-- all spots where Billie Holliday,
Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington and many others played in the twenties,
thirties and forties. When you think of the linkages between jazz and the
Beats, and Cassady's influence on Kerouac, Denver starts to have an even
stronger role in the development of the Beat Generation. Cassady caught some
of the last of the great jazz in the early forties, and when he first dated
Carolyn in 1947 she mentions going to the Rossonian and Neal recommends it
to Kerouac at a later date), but by '49 Kerouac complained that there was no
bop in Denver (he's been introduced to the area by Ed White and Hal Chase
two years earlier). In the first chapter of On The Road, Kerouac writes
about his thoughts on the corner of 27th and Welton during the '49 visit.
Kerouac's ethnic nomenclature dates him, big-time, but the passage documents
a unique American middle-point between alienation and integration: it wasn't
about ethnicity, but about lostness, beatitude, being Beat.

And if you didn't eat before you got on the Beat Train, there is supreme
food to be had in Five Points: Brown Sugar's Burgers n' Bones at 24th and
Welton provides massive rib/burger portions and the juke box has old Al
Green singles -- need I say any more? Ethel's House of Soul is sublime at
26th and Welton, and Zona's Tamales at 27th, across from the Rossonian, is
the place for anything: from holy tamales and ribs to that pig's ear
sandwich that's had your ame on it all these years. There's a sundries store
on the east side of Welton, just up from Ethel's, and now and then (bright,
clear mornings) the owner turns the outside speakers on and the street is
filled with jazz, and R&B classics. One Saturday morning the street was
empty and Aretha Franklin's "You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman)" was
filling the empty street. All that can be said is that it's one form of
heaven on earth.

Stay on the train to its terminus at 30th and Downing so you can get off for
a moment and hop on the same train going back southbound. Look around: In
1934-35 (age 8, 9) Cassady lived briefly nearby, in a duplex at 32nd and
Downing. Sorry to come back to the pleasure of eating, but Tosh's Hacienda
at 3090 Downing has great Mexican food -- just hop and a skip and a...you
get the picture.

On the way back into downtown, you need to make a decision. If you feel like
a short two-block walk (doing this after sundown is not recommended) to
visit the boyhood block that took up so much of Cassady's autobiography, get
off at the 25th & Welton stop and walk west, toward the mountains, on 26th
Avenue. You'll be entering a neighborhood called Curtis Park, and you'll
pass California, Stout and Curtis before reaching 26th and Champa. On the
southwestern corner is a vacant lot next to the mustard-yellow Gertrude.
This is the site where the Snowden apartment house once stood, the center of
Neal's youth during the school months. Looking right you'll see the Puritan
Pie Co. building -- Neal's brothers used to bootleg whiskey in their
apartment next door using the pie aroma as a cover for their activities;
Neal's father used to trade haircuts for pies for the Cassady family in
1932, and his last barber shop was to your left, in the little storefront
near the corner on the east side of Champa. Next to it is The Bakery, where
little Neal used to play (you can still see the painted "Cream Butter Cheese
Eggs" on the storefront windows). Starting on page 97 of Cassady's First
Third you can trace his boyhood on this block. This half block for Cassady
was filled with sexual adventure (and misadventure) along with his
first-ever mind-eyeball-kicks at the hands of his demonic older brother, who
tried repeatedly to suffocate Cassady behind the fold-up bed in the Snowden.

Back on the train (after meditating on how much Cassady survived here as a
child), you'll get to check out everything below 24th again because the
train follows the same route. The southbound train, though, comes through
downtown on Stout Street, where there are two choice Cassady sites. As the
train turns left on Stout off 19th you'll see the former main post office
(now the federal courthouse), passed every day by little Neal on his way to
school from his father's hotel. If it wasn't too cold, Cassady would run
between every column in front of the building before moving on to elementary
school.

Get off the train at the 16th and Stout -- right at the Walgreen's. Cassady
claims to have stolen hundreds of cars in Denver, but in 1949 he wrote to
Kerouac and documented the fact that in 1941 at age 15 he and a friend stole
a car at this intersection. A Plymouth, in case you were wondering.

The Beat Beatific Shuttle

With the Beat Train Tour over, ready for the Beat Shuttle? Catch a westbound
shuttle on the 16th Street Mall. You're taking the same route that Neal took
every afternoon coming home on the trolleys that used to run up and down
16th Street. Four blocks down, at the corner of 16th and Lawrence, you can
look up nd see the Daniel's & Fisher clock tower, once the tallest structure
in Denver, and once at the heart of the block-long Daniel's and Fisher
Department Store. When he stayed with his father, Neal woke at seven by the
chimes of this clock, and as he hurried to get to school on time, he glanced
at this clock to gauge his progress.

You might get off at 16th and Larimer and think about where you are. Even
though you'd have to walk four blocks north to get a feel for the last of
the old skid-row Larimer, you're now standing at the heart of what used to
be the bona fide skid-row that Neal knew as a boy. Cassady's activity was
centered around his father's barbershop, The Zaza, right next to the Zaza
Theater (1727 Larimer). There's not a sign of the old Larimer in the 1700
block -- just modern office buildings built in the seventies and eighties.
But this was where Cassady would spend hours watching movies and reading
voraciously in his father's shop. And on his '49 trek to track Cassady,
Kerouac went to movies here as well.

If you're still at 16th and Larimer, look across to the northwestern corner:
This is where the old Manhattan Restaurant (1635 Larimer) stood for at least
five decades, called "Denver's Most Famous Restaurant" in period
advertisements), and the place where Neal's father's fleabag roommate Shorty
sat and solicited donations to the Shorty cause. To the left once stood the
Citizen's Mission 1617 Larimer) where Neal came for breakfast and dinner. He
and his father had to walk north eight blocks to Father Divine's mission
(24th and Larimer) for lunch.

For an idea of the architecture that was here, go south one block to the
vibrant and wanna-be-hip Larimer Square area between 14th and 15th. An
entrepreneur named Dana Crawford rescued this area in the 60s, but all the
buildings are intact, and this is a perfect time to hop into The Market at
midblock for coffee, a bagel or a sandwich.

From here, you can do a couple of things. Walk up (north) and over (west) to
16th and Market and on the southeastern corner (there's an Office Club store
there right now) you'll be at the site of the dreaded Metropolitan Hotel
(227 16th St.), the fleabag among fleabags where Cassady stayed with his
father most of the time. They moved around to lots of transient hotels, but
The Metropolitan seemed to be his father's favorite locale.

Or, if you're in the mood to visit a modern Denver pool room to say you've
been there, check out Marvin's on 15th between Market and Blake (though you
should know that Cassady's real poolroom hangout was ten blocks east at 15th
and Glenarm, Peterson's Billiard Parlor, at 1519 Glenarm -- there's nothing
there now that even remotely resembles a poolhall). If you do want to go
back in this direction via the 16th Street Mall shuttle, you might want to
know that Allen Ginsberg, in the summer of '47, worked nights vacuuming the
sales floor of May D&F at 15th and Tremont -- it's been closed for a couple
of years and is about to be torn down for an urban shopping mall. And
Cassady worked for May D&F, too, chauffeuring customers to and from the
store parking lot -- making money for driving in a car must have been heaven
for him.

Back in lower downtown, if you want to visit a downright holy bar (and you
do, you do), go up to the Oxford Hotel at 17th and Wazee and seek out the
narrow, orange and thoroughly Deco chamber called The Cruise Room (opens at
4:30 daily -- get there at opening for a seat). It's unchanged from before
prohibition and Cassady almost certainly took a drink or two here. Have a
martini and meditate.

And if you're at the Oxford, glance toward the mountains down 17th Street
and you'll see Union Station, where Neal and his Dad would stop (restroom
break!) on their Sunday walks around the Platte Valley train tracks. At the
moment the main waiting room is huge and beautiful -- a great neglected
public space from another age with long wooden benches and a lunch counter.
Within a year, though, a semi-horrific restaurant chain is putting a
restaurant in the place. Gentrification is always cool until it gets
thoroughly out of hand.

And as you walk around this lower downtown area, you might put a tape of
Kerouac's "Neal and the Three Stooges" meditation into your Walkman -- he
talks about Larimer, Wazee and Wynkoop and the railroad tracks.....and Neal,
of course.

Beat Automobile Tour - The "She Navigate" Tour

My Brother's Bar, 15th and Platte (2376 15th Street), is a great Beat site
(a short drive/long walk from lower downtown. Just go toward the mountains
on 15th. You'll cross the Platte River Valley as you go there -- Cassady was
all over this area as a kid. He called it his "beach."). You'll be drinking
and eating in a bar where Cassady definitely drank -- and it's been in
continuous operation since the days when Neal drank here. There's no sign --
never has been, but it's on the southeastern corner, across from
Shakespeare's Poolhall (modern site) and Maxfield's Bar (great building,
lousy sports bar). Back by the pay phone, hung on the wall, is a letter from
Neal to Jason Brierly! Cassady is writing from juvy hall, asking Brierly to
come to this bar at 15th and Platte to pay off his bar tab. Great stuff.
Almost as great is the famous ``JCB'' - jalapeno cheeseburger -- eat it,
enjoy it.

(Oh, in his autobiography, Neal Cassady talks about his happiness at seeing
the familiar yellow streetcars of Denver after a trip to Los Angeles with
his father. In the parking lot of My Brother's Bar you can see, next to the
Forney Transportation Museum, one of these streetcars.)

Elitch Gardens, 38th Avenue and Tennyson St. If you're at My Brother's with
a car you should probably check this out while you're at it. (Continue up
15th to Zuni, right on Zuni to 38th, left on 38th to Tennyson) The new
Elitches is soulless and downtown; the old Elitches (closed a year ago) was
a century-old garden spot with cool, old rides and Edenic landscaping.
Family picnics were the norm; same for the Beats: Kerouac, Cassady, Ginsberg
and other Denver friends came here and smoked pot in the picnic area -- and
``Elitching'' became the gerund phrase among them for getting high.

Denargo Market, 2901 Broadway. (Go up Market to Broadway (diagonal st.) then
look for 2901) This is the former produce market where Cassady worked; and
where Kerouac worked for a day in the summer of '49 before being asked to
not come back (If you're driving, check this out on you're way up to the
Cassady boy block at 26th and Champa.).

The Colburn Hotel, 9th and Grant Street (980 Grant). (Take 17th Ave. east to
Grant, south on Grant) Another important Beat site near downtown in Denver's
Capitol Hill neighborhood. In the summer of 1947 Carolyn Cassady lived here
(third floor) when she met Neal Cassady. The quasi-famous love triangle went
into overdrive when Ginsberg came out for the summer (Cassady was driving
Carolyn, Allen and Luanne Henderson crazy at the same time, in shifts,
though, on one occasion Neal, Allen and Luanne end up in the same bed at the
Colburn. Ginsberg took a room in the same place until he ran out of money;
then moved in with Neal and Carolyn. Ginsberg wrote "Denver Doldrums" here
and on August 23, 1947, his last day in Denver, watched two bricklayers
working and wrote notes that later became "The Bricklayer's Lunch Hour," a
poem that Ginsberg has categorized as one of his first mature poems.

Civic Center Plaza, Broadway and Colfax. On one end is the state capitol
building, which both Cassady and Kerouac mention in letters (Kerouac watched
bats fly around the dome at night; Cassady and Luanne had a major blow-out
on the capitol lawn). On the other is the City & County Building (Ginsberg
in "The Green Automobile": ``Denver! Denver! we'll return/roaring across the
City & County Building lawn..."), and the current Water Department building,
which was the main Carnegie-given public library when Cassady was a kid; but
Cassady also would have been in the library at its current site across the
park at 14th and Broadway.

6100 West Center, Lakewood, Colorado (formerly Westwood). Kerouac's Home,
June-July, 1949. Modest suburban home in Denver's western suburbs. Take
Broadway south to Alameda, right on Alameda out several miles. Take a left
at the street before Pierce (sorry, can't remember the name)(if you get to
the shopping mall, you've gone too far), south for a few blocks, then a
right on Center--- second house from the corner on the left. Kerouac used
his thousand-dollar advance from The Town and the City on this house with
the idea of moving his mother, sister and brother-in-law here. He'd spent
the previous year fantasizing about Colorado (see letters to Ed White in The
Missouri Review, 1995) and the experiment was, at one level a failure -- his
mother and family hated it and moved back within a month to get their old
jobs back. Kerouac, alone, did valuable research for On The Road, wandering
the downtown streets where Cassady once lived. Robert Giroux, his editor at
Harcourt Brace, visited him here to go over The Town and the City. Kerouac
left Denver for San Francisco at the end of July. The ubiquitous photograph
of Cassady and Kerouac side-by-side was taken shortly after this Denver
period.

Out Colfax, eastward, are a couple of Beat sites. Cassady attended East High
(Colfax and York)(so did singer Judy Collins -- Dylan met her here in '59)
and met Justin Brierly, who taught English here. Kerouac attended a civic
luncheon here with Brierly on June 10, 1949.

At High Street look for 1729 East Colfax. The was a hang-out for teenagers
called The Oasis in 1945. Gas stations remain. Cassady and "Cherry Mary"
Fairland came here after the famous "Cherry Mary" event at her home near
16th and High (I've search the city directories but cannot find the exact
address for any Fairlands living here in the forties.).
