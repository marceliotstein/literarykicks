``Then, further right, the Union Station at the foot of 17th Street came
into view, and unless Dad's firmly-believed-in-restroom call made detour

on its other side.'' [First Third p. 81]

``Sunday was `my day' to...tramp from morn to night over the miles of
countless wonders that I set out to find below the Larimer line of Denver's
bowery in a vast area where more and more often I came to roam away much of
my childhood. Now, father knew this region better than most Denver people,
yet soon not so intimately as my impressionable mind which, once initiated,
expelled much of its early yearning in searches through the ever-new
complexities abounding there in myriad profusion.'' [First Third, ps. 79-80]
