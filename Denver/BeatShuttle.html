<H1>The Beat Beatific Shuttle</H1> 
</CENTER>

With the Beat Train Tour over, ready for the Beat Shuttle? Catch a westbound
shuttle on the 16th Street Mall. You're taking the same route that Neal took
every afternoon coming home on the trolleys that used to run up and down
16th Street. Four blocks down, at the corner of 16th and Lawrence, you can
look up and see the Daniel's & Fisher clock tower, once the tallest structure
in Denver, and once at the heart of the block-long Daniel's and Fisher
Department Store. When he stayed with his father, Neal woke at seven by the
chimes of this clock, and as he hurried to get to school on time, he glanced
at this clock to gauge his progress.<P>

You might get off at 16th and Larimer and think about where you are. Even
though you'd have to walk four blocks north to get a feel for the last of
the old skid-row Larimer, you're now standing at the heart of what used to
be the bona fide skid-row that Neal knew as a boy. Cassady's activity was
centered around his father's barbershop, the Zaza, right next to the Zaza
Theater (1727 Larimer). There's not a sign of the old Larimer in the 1700
block -- just modern office buildings built in the seventies and eighties.
But this was where Cassady would spend hours watching movies and reading
voraciously in his father's shop. And on his '49 trek to track Cassady,
Kerouac went to movies here as well.<P>

If you're still at 16th and Larimer, look across to the northwestern corner:
this is where the old Manhattan Restaurant (1635 Larimer) stood for at least
five decades, called "Denver's Most Famous Restaurant" in period
advertisements), and the place where Neal's father's fleabag roommate Shorty
sat and solicited donations to the Shorty cause. To the left once stood the
Citizen's Mission (1617 Larimer) where Neal came for breakfast and dinner. He
and his father had to walk north eight blocks to Father Divine's mission
(24th and Larimer) for lunch.<P>

For an idea of the architecture that was here, go south one block to the
vibrant and wanna-be-hip Larimer Square area between 14th and 15th. An
entrepreneur named Dana Crawford rescued this area in the 60s, but all the
buildings are intact, and this is a perfect time to hop into The Market at
midblock for coffee, a bagel or a sandwich.<P>

From here, you can do a couple of things. Walk up (north) and over (west) to
16th and Market and on the southeastern corner (there's an Office Club store
there right now) you'll be at the site of the dreaded Metropolitan Hotel
(227 16th St.), the fleabag among fleabags where Cassady stayed with his
father most of the time. They moved around to lots of transient hotels, but
The Metropolitan seemed to be his father's favorite locale.<P>

Or, if you're in the mood to visit a modern Denver pool room to say you've
been there, check out Calvin's on 15th between Market and Blake (though you
should know that Cassady's real poolroom hangout was ten blocks east at 15th
and Glenarm, Peterson's Billiard Parlor, at 1519 Glenarm -- there's nothing
there now that even remotely resembles a poolhall). If you do want to go
back in this direction via the 16th Street Mall shuttle, you might want to
know that Allen Ginsberg, in the summer of '47, worked nights vacuuming the
sales floor of May D&F at 15th and Tremont -- it's been closed for a couple
of years and is about to be torn down for an urban shopping mall. And
Cassady worked for May D&F, too, chauffeuring customers to and from the
store parking lot -- making money for driving in a car must have been heaven
for him.<P>

Back in lower downtown, if you want to visit a downright holy bar (and you
do, you do), go up to the Oxford Hotel at 17th and Wazee and seek out the
narrow, orange and thoroughly Deco chamber called The Cruise Room (opens at
4:30 daily -- get there at opening for a seat). It's unchanged from before
prohibition and Cassady almost certainly took a drink or two here. Have a
martini and meditate.<P>

And if you're at the Oxford, glance toward the mountains down 17th Street
and you'll see 
<A HREF="UnionStation.html">Union Station</A>, 
where Neal and his Dad would stop (restroom
break!) on their Sunday walks around the Platte Valley train tracks. At the
moment the main waiting room is huge and beautiful -- a great neglected
public space from another age with long wooden benches and a lunch counter.
Within a year, though, a semi-horrific restaurant chain is putting a
restaurant in the place. Gentrification is always cool until it gets
thoroughly out of hand.<P>

And as you walk around this lower downtown area, you might put a tape of
Kerouac's "Neal and the Three Stooges" meditation into your Walkman -- he
talks about Larimer, Wazee and Wynkoop and the railroad tracks.....and Neal,
of course.<P>
