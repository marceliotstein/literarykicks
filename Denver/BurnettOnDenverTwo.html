Notes for Denver photographs:

PHOTO #1
23rd Street between Welton and Glenarm.
Cassady's father's barber shop/family residence (left part of photo).
1928/1929. He was two years old.

``There, on 23rd Street between Welton and Glenarm next to the alleyway, was
a brown brick building of miniature dimensions. It housed an incredibly
cluttered shoe-repair shop, the accumulation of a half-century's
leather-litter. The old repairman who squatted daily before the ceiling-high
barrier of sweepings that choked this shop, was Neal's (Sr.) new landlord.
His two-chair barber shop that shared the building with the shoe stall was
acquired on a one-year's lease. Neal, Maude, Jimmy. Betty and little Neal
moved into the crowded quarters in the rear of the shop...Still, with seven
children, conditions in the shop's two small rooms were intolerable. There
were not beds enough; clothes lay everywhere; they could not squeeze
together into the kitchen and so ate in two groups.'' [FT, p. 4]

``[In 1932] On the block-long walk to our Glenarm Street destination, we
paused a moment to stare as Dad once again pointed out all the cluttered
maze behind the window of the shoe-cobbler's next to his first Denver's
barber shop.'' [FT, p. 52]

PHOTO #2
Platte River at 38th Viaduct. Cassady's first ran away from home to this
spot.

``Mainly it was the banks of the Platte that provided the flexuous corridor
for my travels...Near the 38th Avenue U.P. yardoffice, this stack, tempting
for the splendid bicycle hills alongside, was also my destination on my
first run-away-from-home at eight [1934].'' [FT, 83]

PHOTO #3
Holy Ghost Church, 19th and California.
(Cassady was baptized here in 1936; was an altar boy here.)

``...where I once served a year as altar boy without missing a day.'' [FT p.
58]

``...three years I served at Holy Ghost Church as altar boy.'' [FT 158]

PHOTO #4
Father's Last Barber Shop/The Bakery, near 26th & Champa

``Directly across the street was The Bakery, a combination grocery and bake
shop noted for cheap prices that was off and on for years the store to which
I was sent and in front of which I played for long hours.'' [FT 97]

``On The Bakery's left, toward 25th Street, was my first ``Haunted House''
though it comes to mind better as the scene of an early sex experience...''
[FT 97]

``Finally, in the last month of this hectic year [1930], Neal [Sr.] got a
two-chair shop near the corner of 26th and Champa Streets. In this sad
little shop so filled with contention, Neal and Maude shared the last year
of their pitiful marriage.'' [FT, p. 45]

``Neal's non-sobriety persisted as did the dwindling of customers, so that
they just couldn't make ends meet, and Neal lost the shop, the last of
several, early in 1932. He also lost his wife...Little Neal went with his
wino father into the lowest slums of Denver.''

``Next to The Bakery and nudged onto the street corner but for an even more
wedged wane bungalow, was the very barber shop where my parents had last
lived together, and in whose cramped rear quarter sister Shirley and I were
``Colonel and Mrs. Lindbergh'' in the pulldown bed, using the broad
foot-board leverwise to control our plucky ``Spirit of St. Louis.'' [FT 97]

PHOTO #5
Ebert Grammar School. 410 Park Avenue West.
Cassady spent six years here, 1932-1938.

``Then we entered the modern building of gleaming white firebrick that is
Ebert Grammar School...So, in defiance of Denver's geography, I went to
Ebert six straight years. And this was no mean foot-feat: I always lived at
least a mile from the school, and often more even as many as four. In fact,
it was the many mornings of racing these miles (since I seldom had carfare
or would use it if I had) so as not to be late, that must have led to my
becoming so interested in long-distance running.'' [FT, p. 53]

PHOTO #6
Former Main U.S. Post Office, 18th and Stout.

``I...scampered in a weaving run about the fluted sides of every enormous
column that fronted Stout Street, a hundred feet of sidewalk-filled waste
space between curb and building.'' [FT p. 58]

PHOTO #7
18th Street Steps, U.S. Post Office, 18th and Stout

``A springing leap up the 18th Street side of broad stairway that
circumvented the Post Office, to walk through the warmth of its block-long
lobby...''

PHOTO #8
Sacred Heart Catholic Church, 28th and Larimer.
``Little Neal, 3, played every afternoon in the schoolyard directly across
the street.'' [FT, p. 44]

``...especially do I remember my awed listening to a whisper-distorted
recital of Catholic rites in his [Joe, boyhood friend] dingy old church and
school, acred Heart.'' [FT, p. 132]

PHOTO #9
Union Station, 17th and Wynkoop

``Then, further right, the Union Station at the foot of 17th Street came
into view, and unless Dad's firmly-believed-in-restroom call made detour
necessary, we avoided the building because of the deadend trainshed tracks
on its other side.'' [First Third p. 81]

PHOTO #10
The Gertrude, 2545 Champa. The Snowden was to the right of this residence at
2563 Champa, now a vacant lot.

``Now, the apartment house I thus came into when I was approaching the age
of reason was called The Snowden, so named for the very old rake of a
landlord who never came near the place except to take rent in trade at those
apartments so equipped. This mammoth red brick structure, four-storied in
front, three-storied elsewhere, was located in the very heart of a region of
lower eastside Denver that was to become intimate to me over the next
periods of my childhood.'' [FT 97]

``But I knew best The Snowden, that castle of my childhood around which
centered the splintered domesticity of Depression-splotched families such as
mine...it was a rather infamous place, mostly noted as a bootleg stronghold,
although also notorious, over the eastside anyway, for its characters, who
were typical yet unusual enough in their own right: ex-convicts, perverts, a
jazz musician or two, several prostitutes (usually unpimped), addicts
(mainly alcoholic), numerous wild young men. Though mostly visitors of lusty
mind and crooked action, there was too a small normal core of pious parents
such as Mother, struggling for their many children, and maybe even a few
vicarious old maids or bachelors. And although The Snowden occupants were
all poor, or perhaps more so because of it, they rocked the joint night and
day, for the place had a noise mania; the air seemed always filled with
assorted yelping catcalls, shouted curses, frightened screams and, topping
all in my mind, those exciting feminine whoops of laughter. There was hardly
a moment that something untoward wasn't happening... [FT 100-101]

``...here it was that Jimmy would imprison me...These claustrophobic
experiences caused another reaction even more unusual and less easy to
explain -- a reeling of my senses, caused, I imagined, by an offbalanced
wheel whirling around with close clearance inside my skull, which, while
slowly increasing in tempo, set up a loose fan-like vibration as it rotated
into ever-tightening flutter. More exactly, it was simply an awareness that
time in my head had gradually apexed to about triple its ordinary speed of
passage...This time-acceleration came and went of its own accord, making me
thus dizzy-minded (although only while inside my mattressed jail, and then
not every time) all through this first Snowden year.'' [FT 113]

PHOTO #11
20th Street Gym, 20th and Curtis

``Especially on Wednesday and Saturday nights throughout the remainder of
the Thirties did we consistently meet at the Bath House on 20th and Curtis,
a place of shower cleanliness and smut, pool joy and fatigue, gym exertion,
shuffleboard and table tennis skill, which the city provided free for such
as we...'' [FT 103]

PHOTO #12
Union Pacific Train Tracks w/daily 100-car coal train to Pueblo. Area where
Cassady and his father wandered on Sundays. West of lower downtown area.

``Sunday was `my day' to...tramp from morn to night over the miles of
countless wonders that I set out to find below the Larimer line of Denver's
bowery in a vast area where more and more often I came to roam away much of
my childhood. Now, father knew this region better than most Denver people,
yet soon not so intimately as my impressionable mind which, once initiated,
expelled much of its early yearning in searches through the ever-new
complexities abounding there in myriad profusion.'' [FT, 79-80]

PHOTO #13
East side of 2500 block of Champa. Cassady's father's barber shop is on the
far end, then The Bakery, then the site of Cassady's first ``Haunted
House.''

Larimer St. at 20th western side.

PHOTO #16
Larimer St., looking toward 21st, western side.

``I hitch-hike to Denver and...drink huge beers in Larimer Street saloons.''
[Jack Kerouac to John Clellon Holmes, June 24, 1949. Letters, 198]

PHOTO #17
Larimer St., 2100 block, western side.

PHOTO #18
21st and Larimer, southwestern corner.

PHOTO #19
Pasternack's Pawn Shop, 2100 block of Larimer. ``Since 1923''

``I'll live on a barge in the Hudson River, right by the Fulton Fish Market,
and play my chromatic harmonica which I will soon buy in a Larimer Street
pawn shop.'' [Jack Kerouac, Letters, p. 197]

PHOTO #20
Bar entrance at Broadway and Larimer. ``No Children After 5:00''

PHOTO #21
6100 West Center, Lakewood. Jack Kerouac bought this house with the proceeds
of the sale of ``Town and the City'' and lived here from late May/early June
to July of '49.

``I'm going to Colorado in June. My family & I are ready to move out there
if we can find an abode. I am extremely weary of New York--there is no
mystery left in it for me.'' [Jack Kerouac to Allan Harrington, April 23,
1949. Letters, p. 188]

``I have spent my entire one thousand dollars in this huge madness...I am
doing a lot of writing however...'' [Jack Kerouac to John Clellon Holmes,
June 24, 1949. Letters, p. 196]

``I live west of Denver, on the road to Central City.''
[Jack Kerouac to Allen Ginsberg, June 10, 1949. Letters, p. 192]

``...I suddenly took off from New York. This was only a swift decision on an
old idea I had, to establish some kind of ``homestead'' for myself and
family -- an idea I had been harboring for years...I suddenly packed one
night and went, and prayed on the bus that I might have luck in Denver
finding a house and all such matters...The whole idea has really
collapsed.'' [Jack Kerouac to Elbert Lenrow, June 28, 1949. Letters, p. 201]

``No more letters to 6100 W. Center. See you in N.Y. in 2 weeks.'' [Jack
Kerouac to Allen Ginsberg, July 26, 1949. Letters, p. 210]

``...just an hour ago I was standing in my yard looking at the great heat
lightning over the plains, and to the west over the mountains...I had a
desire to go in both directions at the same time.'' [Jack Kerouac to Neal
Cassady, July 28, 1949. Letters, p. 211]

PHOTO #22
Market Street, 1939, looking toward 16th. The Metropolitan Hotel was on the
next corner, around the right corner. The Metropolitan Hotel was formerly at
16th and Market Sts.

``It was the month of my sixth birthday, and the usual fierce winter was
upon the city when my Dad and I moved into the Metropolitan. This is a
five-story building on the corner of 16th & Market Streets, in peril of
collapse. It housed about a hundred of Denver's non-transient bums and still
does, although long ago condemned.''

PHOTO #23
16th and Glenarm, looking west, 1938. Daniels & Fisher clocktower in
distance. Cassady took the trolley every morning down 16th, eastward, on his
way to school.

PHOTO #24
The Manhattan Restaurant, 1950. Open from the late 1890s to 1941, the
Manhattan, called "Denver's Most Famous Restaurant" in advertisements, had
closed by the time this photo was taken. Shorty, the bane of young Neal's
existence in the Metropolitan, would drag himself around the corner to this
spot every day to solicit spare change. The cupid statue still stands,
though a block south, in the 1500 block of Larimer.

PHOTO #25
The Snowden, 26th and Champa. This photo, taken in 1965 by an archivist for
the Denver Public Library, is the only available photograph of the Snowden
(later The Queen City) before it was torn down.

PHOTOS TO COME NEXT WEEK:

Southeastern corner, 25th and Champa
``a half-block-long row of horrible tenements, the cheapest room of which
was just one of the dozens of flops I share with Father over the years. I
remember it was while here that he started a long-continued habit of taking
a large dose of Salts every Sunday morning.'' [FT 99-100]

Puritan Pie Company, Northeastern corner, 26th and Champa
``Although food was short, at least there was always dessert, for in the
middle of the next block was the Puritan Pie Company, and on many an illegal
Sunday the shop shades were drawn as Neal cut an employee's hair in exchange
for a pie or two.'' [FT 46]

``Jack...and...Rita...together with a crippled idiot named Frank...were now
bootlegging from a rear apartment...which...was forever enveloped in heavy
sweet odor from the Puritan Pie Co. that so effectively killed the
incriminating whiskey smell.'' [FT 134]

Baseball field, West Park Avenue (23rd) and Welton

``...23rd and Welton's corner of ballground...'' [FT 118]

Bench, U.S. Post Office, 18th and Stout

``...the mighty colonnaded structure of the Post Office...On the Post Office
corner I would pause for a quick drink at the public fountain which, unlike
most of Denver's, was not shut off in winter...I'd next canter over a huge
stone bench whose giant size made even adults use only its edge for sitting.
I made paradox of the puzzling proverb carved in its granite, for it
cautioned against too much rest while offering it freely: ``Desire rest but
desire not too much.''

27th & WELTON
``At lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching among the lights of
27th and Welton in the Denver colored section, wishing I were a Negro...I
wished I were a Denver Mexican, or even a poor overworked Jap, anything but
what I was o drearily, a `white man' disillusioned. All my life I'd had
white ambitions...'' Jack Kerouac, On The Road

OTHER KEY PHOTOGRAPHS IN PUBLISHED TEXTS

NC on front steps of the Snowden. In Carolyn Cassady's ``Off the Road'', the
b/w picture of little Neal sitting on the front steps was taken at 26th and
Champa. Or is this in the Holy Goof -- taken in '32.

In Jack's Book, the photo of Kerouac at a book signing was taken at the
