<h2>Beat Automobile Tour - The "She Navigate" Tour</h2><p>

My Brother's Bar (2376 15th Street at Platte)  is a great Beat site, just 
a short drive from lower downtown. Go toward the mountains
on 15th. You'll cross the 
<A HREF="Platte38.html">Platte River Valley</A>
as you go there -- Neal was
all over this area as a kid. He called it his "beach." You'll be drinking
 in a bar that's been in continuous operation since the days 
when Neal did.  Back by the pay phone, hung on the wall, is a letter from
Neal to Jason Brierly! Cassady is writing from juvy hall, asking Brierly to
come to My Brother's to pay off his bar tab.<p>

In The First Third,  Cassady talks about his happiness at seeing
the familiar yellow streetcars of Denver after a trip to L.A.  You'll see one
in the parking lot of  My Brother's Bar,  next to the
Forney Transportation Museum.<p>

Elitch Gardens, 38th Avenue and Tennyson St. If you're at My Brother's with
a car you should probably check this out while you're at it. (Continue up
15th to Zuni, right on Zuni to 38th, left on 38th to Tennyson) The new
Elitches is soulless and downtown; the old Elitches (closed a year ago) was
a century-old garden spot with cool, old rides and Edenic landscaping.
Family picnics were the norm; same for the Beats: Kerouac, Cassady, Ginsberg
and other Denver friends came here and smoked pot in the picnic area -- and
``Elitching'' became the gerund phrase among them for getting high.<p>

Denargo Market, 2901 Broadway. (Go up Market to Broadway, then
look for 2901) This is the former produce market where Cassady worked; and
where Kerouac worked for a day in the summer of '49 before being asked to
not come back (If you're driving, check this out on your way up to the
Cassady boy block at 26th and Champa).<p>

The Colburn Hotel, 980 Grant at 9th Street. (Take 17th Ave. east to
Grant, south on Grant) Another important Beat site near downtown in Denver's
Capitol Hill neighborhood. In the summer of 1947 Carolyn Cassady lived here
(third floor) when she met Neal Cassady. The quasi-famous love triangle went
into overdrive when Ginsberg came out for the summer. Cassady was driving
Carolyn, Allen and Luanne Henderson crazy at the same time, in shifts.
Though on one occasion Neal, Allen and Luanne end up in the same bed at the
Colburn. Ginsberg took a room in the same place until he ran out of money;
then moved in with Neal and Carolyn. Ginsberg wrote "Denver Doldrums" here
and on August 23, 1947, his last day in Denver, watched two bricklayers
working and wrote notes that later became "The Bricklayer's Lunch Hour," a
poem that Ginsberg has categorized as one of his first mature poems.<p>

Civic Center Plaza, Broadway and Colfax. On one end is the state capitol
building, which both Cassady and Kerouac mention in letters (Kerouac watched
bats fly around the dome at night; Cassady and Luanne had a major blow-out
on the capitol lawn). On the other is the City & County Building (Ginsberg
in "The Green Automobile": ``Denver! Denver! we'll return/roaring across the
City & County Building lawn..."), and the current Water Department building,
which was the main Carnegie-given public library when Cassady was a kid; but
Cassady also would have been in the library at its current site across the
park at 14th and Broadway.<p>

6100 West Center, Lakewood, Colorado (formerly Westwood). 
<A HREF="6100.html">Kerouac's Home</A>,
June-July, 1949. Modest suburban home in Denver's western suburbs. Take
Broadway south to Alameda, right on Alameda out several miles. Take a left
at the street before Pierce (sorry, can't remember the name - if you get to
the shopping mall, you've gone too far), south for a few blocks, then a
right on Center--- second house from the corner on the left. Kerouac used
his thousand-dollar advance from The Town and the City on this house with
the idea of moving his mother, sister and brother-in-law here. He'd spent
the previous year fantasizing about Colorado (see letters to Ed White in The
Missouri Review, 1995) and the experiment was at one level a failure -- his
mother and family hated it and moved back within a month to get their old
jobs back. Kerouac, alone, did valuable research for On The Road, wandering
the downtown streets where Cassady once lived. Robert Giroux, his editor at
Harcourt Brace, visited him here to go over The Town and the City. Kerouac
left Denver for San Francisco at the end of July. The ubiquitous photograph
of Cassady and Kerouac side-by-side was taken shortly after this Denver
period.<p>

Out Colfax, eastward, are a couple of Beat sites. Cassady attended East High
at Colfax and York (so did singer Judy Collins -- Dylan met her here in '59)
and met Justin Brierly, who taught English here. Kerouac attended a civic
luncheon here with Brierly on June 10, 1949.<p>

At High Street look for 1729 East Colfax. There was a hang-out for teenagers here
called The Oasis in 1945. Gas stations remain. Cassady and "Cherry Mary"
Fairland came here after the famous "Cherry Mary" event at her home near
16th and High (I've searched the city directories but cannot find the exact
address for any Fairlands living here in the forties).<p>
