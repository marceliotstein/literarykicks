``Now, the apartment house I thus came into when I was approaching the age
of reason was called The Snowden, so named for the very old rake of a
landlord who never came near the place except to take rent in trade at those
apartments so equipped. This mammoth red brick structure, four-storied in
front, three-storied elsewhere, was located in the very heart of a region of
lower eastside Denver that was to become intimate to me over the next
periods of my childhood.'' [First Third p. 97]<p>

``But I knew best The Snowden, that castle of my childhood around which
centered the splintered domesticity of Depression-splotched families such as
mine...it was a rather infamous place, mostly noted as a bootleg stronghold,
although also notorious, over the eastside anyway, for its characters, who
were typical yet unusual enough in their own right: ex-convicts, perverts, a
jazz musician or two, several prostitutes (usually unpimped), addicts
(mainly alcoholic), numerous wild young men. Though mostly visitors of lusty
mind and crooked action, there was too a small normal core of pious parents
such as Mother, struggling for their many children, and maybe even a few
vicarious old maids or bachelors. And although The Snowden occupants were
all poor, or perhaps more so because of it, they rocked the joint night and
day, for the place had a noise mania; the air seemed always filled with
assorted yelping catcalls, shouted curses, frightened screams and, topping
all in my mind, those exciting feminine whoops of laughter. There was hardly
a moment that something untoward wasn't happening... " [First Third ps. 100-101]<p>

``...here it was that Jimmy would imprison me...These claustrophobic
experiences caused another reaction even more unusual and less easy to
explain -- a reeling of my senses, caused, I imagined, by an offbalanced
wheel whirling around with close clearance inside my skull, which, while
slowly increasing in tempo, set up a loose fan-like vibration as it rotated
into ever-tightening flutter. More exactly, it was simply an awareness that
time in my head had gradually apexed to about triple its ordinary speed of
passage...This time-acceleration came and went of its own accord, making me
thus dizzy-minded (although only while inside my mattressed jail, and then
not every time) all through this first Snowden year.'' [First Third, p. 113]
