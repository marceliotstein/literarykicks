               OCTOBER EARTH was a month-long group writing project that took place on LitKicks.com.  
               Each day in October 2004, we presented a provocative topic for 
               discussion, accompanied by a quote or excerpt from a well-known 
               (or should-be well-known) author or poet.  
               We invited participants to respond with  
               their own thoughts, ideas or further questions.

         THE CONCEPT
         </font>
         <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"> Our world is torn by ideological 
          conflict. In America, two different news networks often deliver wildly 
          different versions of each day's events. Around the world, people of 
          different nations, religions or cultural backgrounds face off against 
          each other in hatred and suspicion. <BR>
          <BR>
          OCTOBER EARTH is a group exercise for a divided world. Each day will 
          be a chance to confront our own ideas and ideals. The daily exercises 
          will ask some tough 
          questions, but we are not interested in emphasizing the ways we all 
          disagree. Instead, we want to discover what we all feel together -- 
          what we all love, what we all hate, what we all wish for. To the extent 
          that OCTOBER EARTH is a debate, we want it to be a "sympathetic debate". 
          We want to hear your beliefs, but we want you to hear everybody else's 
          beliefs as well. The only way to win this debate is to change your own 
          mind about something. <BR>
          <BR>
          Along with the harder questions, there will also be some lighter moments. 
          OCTOBER EARTH is designed to be a valuable learning experience, and 
          we think it will be a good time too. </font></p>

          If you'd like to help in the preparations for the event, you could also 
          recommend a literary quotation or excerpt for us to present as daily 
          conversation-starters. Our aim is to represent a wide range of literary 
          styles, backgrounds, time periods and levels of fame.<BR>
          <BR>
          If you can know of an interesting piece of writing that fits our concept 
          (see box on left), please <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/earthpost.jsp">send 
          us a note</A>.<BR>

          Finally, the most important way you can help is by emailing the URL 
          of this page to anybody who you think might be interested. We want to
