               OCTOBER EARTH is a group writing project from LitKicks.com.  
               Each day, we will present a provocative topic for 
               discussion, accompanied by an excerpt from a well-known 
               (or should-be well-known) author or poet.  
               We will invite participants to respond with  
               their own thoughts, ideas or further questions.  Please join us 
               starting on Friday, October 1.

         <b>THE CONCEPT</b>
         </font>
         <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">
          Our world is torn by ideological conflict.  In America, two different news networks deliver wildly different versions of each day's events to their respective audiences.  Around the world, people of different nations, religions or cultural backgrounds face off against each other with hatred and suspicion.  <BR><BR>
          OCTOBER EARTH is a group exercise for a divided world.  Each day's writing topic will be a chance to confront our own ideas and ideals.  We will ask some tough questions, but we are not interested in emphasizing the ways we all disagree.  Instead, we want to discover what we all feel together -- what we all love, what we all hate, what we all wish for.  To the extent that OCTOBER EARTH is a debate, we want it to be a "sympathetic debate".  We want to hear your beliefs, but we want you to hear everybody else's beliefs as well.  The only way to win this debate is to change your own mind about something. <BR><BR>
          Along with the harder questions, we're also planning some lighter moments.  OCTOBER EARTH is designed to be a valuable learning experience, and hopefully a good time too.

         <b>JOIN IN</b>
         </font>
         <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">
          The main way to participate is to show up on LitKicks.com between October 1 and October 31.  One new discussion topic will be posted each day.  You are invited to participate in any or all of the discussions.<BR><BR>
          If you'd like to help in the preparations for the event, you could also recommend a literary quotation or excerpt for us to present as daily conversation-starters.  We will be putting up a new excerpt or quotation each day, and we're happy to take suggestions.  We want to represent a wide range of literary styles, backgrounds, time periods and levels of fame.<BR><BR>  
If you can think of an interesting piece of writing that fits our concept (see box on left), please <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/earthquote.jsp">send us a note</A>.<BR><BR>
         Finally, the most important way you can help is by emailing the URL of this page to anybody who you think might be interested.  We want to reach every country and city in the world, every ethnic and religious group, every age group, both genders ... you get the idea.  If you can help us reach people who might enjoy participating, please do.  Internet virgins are welcome, as long as they can spell.
