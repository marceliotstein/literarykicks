                  The sound of peace crept politely into his head. It waited patiently outside his ear until it was invited in, then, with slippered feet it entered his aural passage. It came in on the wings of a sparrow’s chirp, a tree’s rustle and the sound of a paper-boys spokes. It immediately started fondling his dreams. The dreams fondled back.<BR><BR>

He stirred slightly.<BR><BR>

Morning waited. It’s patient like that.<BR><BR>

He stirred again, moving his left leg slightly.<BR><BR>

An almost silent symphony played all around him. Engulfed him. Dew slid down grass blades as they reached as far east as they could to greet the new sun. They were very eager this morning.<BR><BR>

He raised his right hand and rubbed his torso with it. His pyjamas were damp. He then lifted the hand to his face, wiped it a bit and returned it to his side where he could easily get it again if he needed it.<BR><BR>

The smell of crisp, moist life was pulled quickly in through his nostrils. It played with the remnants of his now fleeting dreams for a moment and was expelled through a small slit in his lips. The dreams went happily back into their cubby-holes with contented grins and slightly stiffened nipples.<BR><BR> 

His eyelashes seemed to be the only problem. They were clinging tightly to one another and didn’t seem to want to let go. They were much stronger than he remembered them to be and, from this angle, they looked to him like great bridges that spanned everything.<BR><BR>

Blue. <BR><BR>

Blue eased the stubborn lashes apart with a bit of gentle coaxing and warmly massaged his retinas into perception.<BR><BR>

“Morning.” The world said to him.<BR><BR>
“Morning.” Warren answered back as he slowly peeled himself off his dewy bed. He looked up and down the quiet street. He paused for a moment. Warren then shook his head a bit to shuffle the stubborn dream-bits back to their places, stretched a big godly one, turned and walked towards his front door.<BR><BR>


Warren slept on the front lawn sometimes. Just sometimes.<BR><BR>

                  The steeltown I grew up in didn't have a lot to offer tourists. I suppose you could count the Hot Dog Shoppe - home of the best ever chili dogs and fries. Or maybe the Playhouse, though that was overrated. It smelled like armpits and wet carpet and never had any good shows. My mom went to see Paul Lynde there once. She came home all flushed and laughing - and since she didn't have time to make dinner, we got a box of those great hotdogs.<BR><BR> 

Dad worked at the mill and made what everyone described as "pretty good money". I don't know what "pretty good money" was in the sixties, but we lived on the downwind side of the mill in an old seafoam green house. Or it would have been seafoam green were it not for the soot. My dad was pretty careful with his money so that for four weeks out of the year we could soak in the ocean. I knew it was a privilege. The neighbor kids never got further than Quinby park. Talk about armpit smell. <BR><BR>


These vacations took a lot of preparation. The trailer had to be cleaned and packed carefully. Dad was a real stickler over the packing. Once, a watermelon that had been stowed under a table broke loose while we were careening down the highway. The melon rolled back and forth and back and forth and the whole trailer started fishtailing - just because of a stupid melon! My mom had the sad luck to be driving that day. She did what my dad yelled at her to do and pulled us out of it though. She rarely drove when we pulled the trailer after that. My dad's yelling had that sort of effect on you.<BR><BR>


My little brother Ken and I didn't have to do anything to get ready. We were just kids, after all. The night before leaving it was so hard to sleep. We strung an old jump rope - the hollow plastic tube kind, like a garden hose - between our rooms. If you closed your mouth around the handle and talked...it was like a can and string effect.<BR><BR> 

<i>"Hey Betsy...you asleep?" </i><BR><BR>

I knew when he finally was once the rope got slack. I pictured him in there still holding the handle. Talking in his sleep about rafts and waves and the penny candy we got for the trip. I tried harder to sleep then, because we were leaving around dawn.<BR><BR>


Every year it was the same.<BR><BR>


I'd hear everyone shuffling around. Not quietly, either. The idea of being-quiet-because-the-kids-are-sleeping was long forgotten by kids number five and six. Ken's scrunched voice came through the tube all whispery. The plan was in motion.<BR><BR>

I looked out my window down at the station wagon. The back hatch was open and my older brother Denny was making a bed out of old sleeping bags and pillows. This was for Ken and me. Our headboard was a red metal cooler (also strategically packed) with comics piled on it. And a huge bag of penny candy. Denny would be moving that, though. We never got the whole bag. <BR><BR>

Mouth scrunched around the jumprope phone, <i>"Kenny. They're doing the car." </i><BR><BR>

<i>"oohkay".</i><BR><BR>

Next was yelling. If it's possible, it was a hushed yelling. My dad didn't want to wake up the neighbors, but he sure wanted to yell at my brother Tom who wasn't giving good back up directions when he was trying to hook up the trailer. <BR><BR>

Jump rope phone: <i>"Kenny. They're hookin' up the trailer" </i><BR><BR>

<i>"Ooohkay".</i><BR><BR>

This was it. Up the stairs came Denny, who was a pretty big guy. He played football even though he had asthma and wasn't really supposed to. First he came to my room. I closed my eyes and flung an arm casually over a pillow to do my best to look like I was sleeping. Denny sort of snickered and picked me up. He carried me down the steep steps that just last week I tried to somersault down. Well, I did, but it hurt more than I thought it would. Anyway, he carried me to the car and set me in there. Arranged my arm over a pillow, even. He laughed and went back upstairs for Ken.<BR><BR> 

When Denny came back with Ken, I opened my eyes and sat up a bit to watch. Kenny's idea of appearing to be asleep was to snore really loud like they do in cartoons and clench his eyes shut. Denny bit his lip and said to my mom in his most serious voice, "Oh yeah. He's sound asleep..."<BR><BR>

That was our gig. Not the Playhouse, granted, but we invented it and were pretty pleased with it, overall.<BR><BR> 

Once the car started moving and we were out of town on the highway, I'd watch the sunlight swell into the back window and listen to my parents talk about what they forgot to pack. The soot in the sky glowed orange this early and the dew was diamond sparkle on the window glass. In the distance, my town looked small and everything good and clean was moving toward me at the speed of morning.<BR><BR>

                  "It's all about choices," declared the merchant. "You're a person of intellect, right? Well, I mean intellect balanced with... I don't know. Whatever it is that makes us human. You follow your heart, your mind... Either way, you end up making choices. About what to believe, I mean. And when you're ready to buy, you end up here, at Belief Warehouse."<BR><BR>"I'm just browsing," said Lüuka. "Comparing alternative structures, looking for ideas. I haven't quite made up my mind yet."<BR><BR>"Oh, you think not?" scoffed the grizzled old man, shaking his head. "Well, that's a belief as well. A false one. Give it a little consideration, a little introspection... You'll see. Hmmm..." he squinted at her. "I could be wrong, but uh... I peg you as a liberal. Capitalist, of course..."<BR><BR>Lüuka took a deep breath. "Well," she responded cautiously, "I don't know that we should... I mean, I'm not quite comfortable with..."<BR><BR>"Yeah, I know," acknowledged the man. "People can be very protective of their beliefs. That's why we package everything here in metal cans. Some places will sell you beliefs wrapped in tissue or plastic -- or even loose off the shelf. But not at Belief Warehouse. Here, everything is hermetically sealed in titanium alloy canisters. Some people think beliefs last longer that way -- less susceptible to contamination. That's important, you understand. I mean, when you've got every conceivable principle under one roof, you've got to keep things in their place. Or at least allow for that perception."<BR><BR>"This showroom is enormous," exclaimed Lüuka, scanning the cavernous expanse of inventory. "When I walked in... I mean, from the outside, I didn't realize what I was getting into."<BR><BR>"Well, it's different for every person," explained the merchant, leading her deeper into the crisscrossing labyrinth (confused, like tangled neurons). "Some people come here because they're comfortable with abstractions, and they just want to examine the options. Others are more literal and really think they can purchase this stuff. But, uh... Either way, I think you'll find we're quite well organized. I mean, once you allow for the vague nature of our product. Basically, it's all categorized by aisle."<BR><BR>"What about all those baseless notions that seem so popular?" Lüuka asked. "You know... Fake moon missions, the flat Earth, conspiracy doctrines...?"<BR><BR>"Oh, that..." sighed the man. "Well, you see, those aren't really beliefs -- I mean, in the true sense of 'conviction.' They're just speculative <I>ideas.</I> Quite tangible, for the most part."<BR><BR>"Yeah, I suppose... A different niche."<BR><BR>"Even so, we stock a few of the more popular ones as novelty items. Impulse buys on display by the register. But none of that stuff is profitable, because it's worth so little to begin with."<BR><BR>"Do you offer layaway plans?" Lüuka inquired.<BR><BR>"Of course not," snorted the merchant. "I mean, once you've made up your mind on a belief, you can't very well leave it behind. It's yours. I mean, how you reconcile it is your business."<BR><BR>"Yeah, I suppose that makes sense. But I'm concerned about cost."<BR><BR>"Well, most beliefs are just trinkets," conceded the man. "We just give them away in bulk. But, you're right... Certain beliefs can be <I>very</I> expensive. They'll cost you your livelihood, your love, your life, your limb... Perhaps even your <I>soul.</I> I mean, if you believe in that sort of thing. And if not... Well, we can fix you up." He stopped before an expanse of well-repaired shelving. "Here," announced the man. "This is the Politics aisle. You'll notice we stock liberal beliefs on the left side of the aisle, and conservative on the right."<BR><BR>"Well, assuming you browse in <I>this</I> direction," Lüuka countered. "The moment you turn around and come back, everything's reversed."<BR><BR>"Uh... Actually not," corrected the man. "That's the strange thing about Politics. It's more of a circle than a spectrum, and it's all relative. You can try to turn things around -- God knows, it's been done -- but ultimately..."<BR><BR>Lüuka reached tentatively...<BR><BR>"Careful," warned the man. "Be wary of beliefs stocked on the right. They spend obscene money on packaging and marketing, and are notorious for mislabeling. But if you scrutinize the ingredients, you'll see that all you're buying into is callous, self-serving greed."<BR><BR>"Not to mention self-righteousness," Lüuka added. "And intolerance."<BR><BR>"Ah... You've shopped this aisle before," realized the vendor. "Well, their self-righteousness isn't a belief per se. It's probably a defensive reaction invoked by a sense of shame. I mean, assuming they have any left. The intolerance is characteristic of their general fear and hatred. But, uh... That's just my own, uh... Observation. Anyway, I guess they've got to sell their beliefs somehow, and continual repackaging has proven curiously effective." The man squinted at an elaborate display of canisters stacked in the center of the aisle. "Now, here's a prime example," he snorted. "I don't know how <I>these</I> ended up getting stocked with the Midway Moderate lines. People come in here trying to be evasive, and they walk out with Compassionate Conservatism. It's disgraceful."<BR><BR>"Well, I think that's why I'm here," said Lüuka. "Looking for something less convoluted."<BR><BR>"Not quite sure how you mean that," said the man, scratching his chin. "I mean, if you're a connoisseur or collector, you can still find Marxism, Federalism, Mösknvorrism, et cetera, stocked down at the end. But if you're just an idealist, that stuff's a bit radical. I mean, you want your beliefs to fit the general framework, don't you?"<BR><BR>"I hesitate to ask," she ventured. "But, uh..."<BR><BR>"Aisle six," answered the man. "It's funny... Strange, I mean. Everyone seems hesitant to bring up Religion. But that's our most popular item -- in a broad sense, I mean. Fundamental."<BR><BR>"Oh, yes..." cooed Lüuka. "May I look? I mean, I'm just curious, you understand."<BR><BR>The old man shuffled to the sixth aisle and gestured with an open hand. "It's all here," he declared. "Kind of hard to keep these beliefs sorted in neat categories, so you might have to scrounge a bit to find exactly what you're after."<BR><BR>Lüuka squinted at the extensive line of product, stacked neatly on gilded shelves extending farther than the eye... "There's so much of it," she observed. "It's overwhelming."<BR><BR>"Humph," barked the man. "Look at it from my point of view, as a humble shopkeeper, I mean. This aisle is infinitely long, filled beyond capacity, with new product arriving daily. East, West, old, new..."<BR><BR>"I don't know where to start."<BR><BR>"Well, follow me," offered the man as he set off down the corridor. "You know, when I help people find things in this aisle, I used to say, 'I am the way.' As a joke, you understand. But, uh... That sometimes doesn't go over so well."<BR><BR>The man stopped before a colorful expanse of product. "You might start by choosing a God," he suggested. "Of course, the basic Old Testament versions are among the most popular, but I think you'll find we're well stocked in all the variations. I mean, you could even go with a lowercase 'g,' if you prefer."<BR><BR>"I... I have trouble telling the difference. Could you possibly <I>recommend</I> one?"<BR><BR>With little forethought, the merchant snatched a can from the shelf. "A white-bearded old man," he offered. "Very popular item. Produced by a major manufacturer and endorsed by numerous factions. General-purpose. Over eighty percent ecumenical..."<BR><BR>"Oh," said Lüuka, squinting at the can's ingredient label. "But is this a <I>benevolent</I> God?"<BR><BR>"Uh, no..." admitted the shopkeeper. "Actually, that one is rather vindictive. Most people seem to identify with that -- conservatives especially. If you actually want a 'loving' God... Well, you limit your choices substantially, but there's still an impressive realm, depending on the qualifications you choose to impose."<BR><BR>Lüuka returned the bearded old man to His spot on the shelf. "No," she decided, "none of these seem right. It's hard to explain, but I think there's something wrong with the packaging."<BR><BR>"Yeah, well... Easy to sell that way," rationalized the vendor. "It's a business, you know."<BR><BR>"But don't you have...? You know... The <I>true</I> God?"<BR><BR>The merchant eyed her skeptically. "You don't see Him here?" he challenged, spreading his arms. "We stock infinitely many choices, and you've only glanced at a couple. If I didn't know better, I'd say you weren't ready to buy. Heck, you can even customize. Buy a generic version and equip Her with whatever suits you. That's very popular these days, and not just among the fringe cults. Belief accessories are myriad in this department."<BR><BR>"No," Lüuka insisted. "I know what I want, and it's not here. Not on these shelves."<BR><BR>The man knit his brow. "Okay, follow me," he relented. "Behind the counter. No place for what you're seeking out on the floor." He shuffled back and retrieved the coveted item, placing a non-descript tin on the counter.<BR><BR>"It's small," Lüuka realized. "I mean, I expected it to be bigger. You know... All encompassing."<BR><BR>"Packaging," reminded the man.<BR><BR>"But there's no label. How do I know what the ingredients are? Or what religion exactly...?"<BR><BR>The old man shrugged. "Either you know, or you don't," he proclaimed. "That's faith. And if you don't have that... Well, then you may as well just buy something off the shelf."<BR><BR>Lüuka nodded. "You're right," she admitted. "This is it."<BR><BR>"Are you certain?"<BR><BR>"Absolutely," Lüuka insisted. "I need this. And, uh... Price is no object."<BR><BR>The belief merchant took the can back and returned it to its spot under the counter. "Well, then you already have it," he proclaimed. "There's nothing I can sell you."<BR>

                  I can't remember the dream but the light was coming in through the wrong window when I woke up and I realized that things weren't the way they were supposed to be, so I covered my head and tried to go back to sleep.<BR><BR>

There had to have been a dream.<BR><BR>

Most moonlight breaks easy, but I hadn't had more than a few hours of sleep in the past several weeks, so every little bit that came in through the cracks made my mind squint. My head was caving in.<BR><BR>

The elderly couple in the apartment on the other side of the wall were throwing each other across their dining room again. Lots of glass and crashing. I threw the pillow at them; it didn't make a sound but it broke through the wall like a rock through a giant marshmallow.<BR><BR>

I held my eyes closed and tried.<BR><BR>

I fell out of bed and found my way to the hall. It was raining. In the hall. I jogged towards the bathroom but it wasn't there. The doorways changed. Hacksaw masked man madman waiting in the lefthand bedroom for me, and I tripped trying to catch my breath.<BR><BR>

I had been laying on my hip for hours, and it was numb. The list of things to do in the morning started scrolling behind my eyelids and then the works jammed up with the bulk of it stuck, stuck tilted in its mechanical momentum jam and a yellow light flickered from behind, and a clackity-clack. Black and white. The 12-year-old boy in striped shirt and small cap ran to the back of the theater and banged on the door. Something started whirring and the list scrolled away.<BR><BR>

My head was caving in.<BR><BR>

Birds starting flying and there was a burning car outside; things were getting rolling. I opened up my eyes. There was an American dream dying in my belly and I knew this and I cried. I still had the pillow. Roll over and try again.<BR><BR>

Kevin would be waiting for me. Angie would wonder why I hadn't called. Michael would never know the difference; he would only feel a hollow loss. There's the hacksaw again and another tree came down. Press on.<BR><BR>

It happened with a jolt, simply. As if there was never a light and the only madman rested cackling in the background, under cover of consciousness. As if.<BR><BR>

The lights came on and I heard the distant rumble of humanity. I splashed water on my face, wondering how I got there, and dressed.<BR><BR>

mid-september<BR><BR>

the belfry tower<BR>
down on fifth and main<BR>
yawns a white fog<BR>
from groggy window eyes<BR><BR>

a cat saunters down the alley<BR>
behind Trail’s End Café<BR>
moaning quiet vowels<BR><BR>

blinks off suddenly<BR>

over the rooflines of town<BR><BR>

one dog barks into the sunrise<BR>
behind frigid grey fences<BR>
as a cloud of breath <BR>
hovers a halo around his snout<BR><BR>

orange and brown leaves <BR>
crinkle in a miniature curbside tornado<BR><BR>

a boy wearing red rides his bike<BR>
through the settling torrential apricot ballet<BR><BR>

day breaks with broken silence <BR>
as a rusty farm truck rumbles by <BR>
carrying white pumpkins<BR>
toward harvest tables<BR><BR>

morning unfurls slowly<BR>

of a solitary bell<BR><BR>

                  this is probably a mistake, a result of some stupid emotion...i shouldn't post this because i should give it some thought and try to come up with something more creative and slaphappy genius so i can try to advance to the next round. but then again, we're all in this together and i want you all to succeed just like i want me to succeed so i'm going with a little off-the-cuff here and just throwing this out there to see how it looks after litkicks slaps its html on it and if it bombs, it bombs, but it's me and it's the most immediate thing that happened at the end of my fingers and my thoughts after i read the week 3 assignment, so here's to ti jean and first thought best thought...<BR><BR><strong>i believe</strong><BR><BR>I believe in nothing.<BR><BR>There is a park bench in Battery Park beneath an oak tree that you can sit on and see the Statue of Liberty, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, and, between the buildings, the Brooklyn Bridge, all at the same time. <BR><BR>I believe in luck that means nothing. I don’t believe in curses or ghosts. I believe that our mind can make up anything it wants to, and that makes anything real. I believe in the spectrum, but I don’t believe in chartreuse.<BR><BR>I can hold my hands behind my head and they will go numb. There are at least three bad vertebrae in my spine which are the result of constant pulling by the lumbar muscles on the right side of my back. I grew up thinking starboard meant left and port meant right because I grew up going backwards in boats.<BR><BR>I believe that green is the same for everyone, even though I have no proof of that.<BR><BR>The last time I was in New York I paused and cried and left for the last time, perhaps. I believe in perhaps, because I need to.<BR><BR>When I was a child, I had dreams and a vivid imagination. I don’t have many more dreams these days, and my imagination leads to nightmares.<BR><BR>I believe that life is a process of improvement, even though I have a lot of proof otherwise.<BR><BR>There is an artist who sits on the sidewalk south of the Central Park zoo who will draw your picture for five dollars. He’s never met you before but if you give him five dollars, he will cause you to question your own identity for days, and all your friends will pretend that your nose is just fine.<BR><BR>And there are animals nearby, in cages. One of them, once, had to see a therapist. He was a polar bear (the animal, not the therapist). He went in circles all day, while Nomar Garciaparra makes millions and has a pretty girlfriend. People laugh at the polar bear.<BR><BR>I believe that obsession is the key to longevity, and I would swim all day if only they’d let me.<BR><BR>Everything in moderation. <BR><BR>I believe that the moon rises and the sun sets and people change every time they wake up, even though, technically, I realize that none of those things are actually true.<BR><BR>An artist can find beauty in a momentary glimpse of a young child watching a car drive by on a dingy interstate during rush hour in the Los Angeles smog, from behind a chain link fence next to a graveyard filled with high schoolers. Beauty.<BR><BR>Every brilliant sunlight flower I ever see in Battery Park will forever be covered in ash.<BR><BR>I haven’t made up my mind about religion yet, but I’m sure that everyone can live forever.<BR><BR>I believe in prayer and ceremony and solemnity, even though sometimes it gets me down.<BR><BR>I believe everything I read, for a minute. This is the cause of great variations in my mood.<BR><BR>I believe in faith and despair.<BR><BR>When a young woman watches an old man step in front of a bus on Broadway she is forever changed. Her name is Angela. She rides the subway home as if in a trance. She walks up the steps of her Park Slope brownstone and slips on the top stair and catches herself on the rail. She holds on for a moment and then lowers herself to the step and sits, and she begins to cry, small sobs like from a child. She’s crying right now, and I believe that you can hear her.<BR><BR>I like things to be linear because I know that nothing is. I like to pretend that I can make sense of everything. I’ve spent my life trying to give everything a set of rules. I haven’t told anyone what all of these rules are, but I get very angry when they are broken. I’ve spent my life giving everything a set of rules, but I believe them to be natural and inherent to everyone. Despite this desire for order, I refuse to try to learn about order. I refuse chemistry. I don’t want to know how the body is constructed because I would rather believe that we are the chance manifestation of ephemeral souls rather than carbon-based playthings of a creative universe. When I look out the window of an airplane, I pretend that I don’t see the rivets or the hinges on the wing, because I’d rather believe that airplanes fly by magic than by mechanics that can fail.<BR><BR>I hate you, but I would give my life for you. I love you, but I will berate you with anger in order to make myself feel better.<BR><BR>I believe that all people are good. I believe that any combination of any two people can produce evil, and usually does. This isnt why I don’t believe in math, but I don’t believe in math.<BR><BR>I still have dreams where I’m in high school and I’ve neglected to go to math class for the entire quarter. I’m about to graduate, but I have one more test to take, and it’s in math. I’ve never gone to class. I have notes from somewhere, and these will help me pass the test, but they’re in my locker and I can’t find my locker. I find my locker but the combination escapes me. The bell has rung. The hallways are emptying. I need to take this test. I need to get to class.<BR><BR>There is a day in Manhattan, there is a temperature and an angle of the sun and a direction of the breeze, that will bring me to my knees. It’s only in Manhattan, but I know that if that day were to happen here, where I am now, it would bring me to my knees. But perhaps it won’t happen, that day, and I’ll keep standing. I have to believe in perhaps.<BR><BR>I believe that nothing ever dies. I believe that buildings never fall and children never kill and mothers never fail and liars never win and bodies never bleed and nothing ever dies and nothing ever dies and nothing ever dies.<BR><BR>I do believe in nothing.  I do.<BR><BR>

                  I didn’t know what sex was. I had heard the word ‘cunt’ before, Sean Caswell told me it was the worst word of them all. Even worse than ‘fuck’ he said. But that was the extent of my sexual orientation at the time. I was nine.<BR><BR>Me, David and his cousin Ronnie were hanging out on the twirly slide when David announced that he had ‘humped’ her. <BR>“Sally?” Ronnie confirmed.<BR>“Yeah, right on her front porch.”<BR>“No way.” Ronnie plopped down and looked David straight in the face. I had never seen that kind of confrontation before. Being younger by a few years, I just assumed that I had to believe everything David said. Ronnie didn’t though. This was straight-on defiance.<BR>“You’re fulla shit. You didn’t hump her.”<BR>“Well, I did.” David said with his usual irritating twelve-year-old arrogance.<BR>“Humped…?” I asked.<BR>Ronnie filled me in, “Yeah, Diamond Dave here is trying to tell us that he had sex with Sally Doucet.”<BR>“Oh…OHH!” I clued in, if only slightly.<BR>“Well, I didn’t say SE-EX.” David clarified.<BR>“Well, DUH! You said you humped her. How did you do it?”<BR>“I rubbed my wang against her. A LOT! And I went ‘oooohhhh’ and she was going ‘ahhhh’ and I humped her.”<BR>“Were you naked?”<BR>“What?”<BR>“Were you naked?”<BR>“No!”<BR>“Well then, y’dumb Stooge, you didn’t hump her. You have to be naked to hump a girl!”<BR>“What?” Dave and I said in Dolby.<BR>“You have to be naked and rub your wang against her and go ‘ohh’ and ‘ahh’ to hump a girl. That’s what humping is! Retard.”<BR>“Well…” David floundered and went silent.<BR><BR>I still didn’t know what sex was, or really what humping was either, but I did learn a vital lesson that day: David Myers DIDN’T know everything. <BR>

                  I wasn't driving a hundred miles an hour but I was driving much faster than I normally would. Who could believe there was no speed limit in Montana? Pictographs on roadsigns showed squiggles of high winds teetering trucks onto wheel's edge. The horizon was a western movie starring only me. I'd like to see this again. Maybe someday, when I wasn't careening across the landscape in my husband's SUV stuffed with garbage bags of clothes and recent bills. A three foot ficus was buckled in the passenger seat for company. I named him Mike. Mike Ficus. You do things like that driving 3,056 miles across the country alone.<BR><BR>A while back I crossed The Continental Divide. The signs announcing it for miles got me itching to see a grand ridge with a shining gate. Turns out it's nothing more than another green blur of a sign, though, at 75 mph. I pointed it out to Mike, all the same. That way flows east, this flows west. <BR><BR>I pulled into the Flying J for gas. When the wind wasn't whipping my eyes to tears, I looked around the station. A sasquatch of a man was staring at me with one unpatched eye and for a second, I saw myself through it, too. Small woman in a Boiled Wool JCrew Car Coat, Nutmeg. Tiny oiled leather boots - good for nothing in this place - tapping frantically while the tank slowly filled. He'd see my Connecticut plates, too, as I squealed out of the lot. If I was going to get to Seattle by midnight, there was no time for musing.<BR><BR>There would be no warning flare of a cellphone call to my husband, either. <BR><BR>I squinted through one eye and leaned forward, easily passing a hundred. <BR><BR>

                  <b>First message, sent today at 6:51 AM:</b> Uh, hi. This is Dr. Sütrv. I'm a surgical resident down at the hospital, and I need to reach Dr. Kördann. The reason, uh... It's about ten to seven, Tuesday morning. Um... We've got a critical situation here that's, uh... Well, I've got a patient sliced open on the table. He's in stable condition on the machine, but... Well, I've found a strange device in his thoracic cavity. It's under the folds of the cytoplasmic ligature -- seems to be attached somehow to the deleroid nerve cluster. Uh... No idea what it is or what it's supposed to be doing, but... Um... It seems to be leaking a bluish fluid. A few cc's have gobbed up near the supinoial artery -- definitely not water-soluble. Anyway, the reason I’m calling you is, um... The device has your name and phone number engraved on it. And, uh... Well, I don't know quite how to put this, but... Well, it looks like it might be a custom unit. You know... Homemade. I mean... I'm not implying that it's unapproved or anything. I'm sure it was installed under established protocol. But since it has your name on it, I just thought you should know. I'll call the service to have you paged. We're at extension 7993.<BR><BR><b>Next message ... 7:11 AM:</b> Dr. Sütrv again for Dr. Kördann. Um... It's critical now. That device is smoking. We've tried cooling it with saline, but it's <i>hot.</i> I want to yank it, but the way it's tied into the deleroids... Dr. Gnuundärd from Neurology says she's never seen anything like it. Please advise. Extension 7993.<BR><BR><b>Next message ... 7:27 AM:</b> <i>[-inaudible-]</i><BR><BR><b>Next message ... 7:29 AM:</b> <i>[-inaudible-]</i><BR><BR><b>Next message ... 7:59 AM:</b> Dr. Sütrv again. Disregard my previous messages.<BR><BR>
