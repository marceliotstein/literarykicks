<CENTER>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</CENTER>
<blockquote>

<B>What is the Freestyle Writing Workshop?</B><BR><BR>

The Freestyle Writing Workshop is a writing workshop produced by LitKicks.com.  It is based on The QUEST, a writing workshop and tournament that took place on LitKicks in October 2003.  Unlike The QUEST, the Freestyle Writing Workshop is designed to operate continuously, and there is no contest involved.  The first session of the Freestyle Writing Workshop will run from November 17 to December 31, 2003, and there is an entry fee of $20.  <BR><BR>

<B>What kinds of writers participate in the Freestyle Writing Workshop? How do I know if I'm qualified?</B><BR><BR>

The Workshop is designed for "regular people", and no writing experience or credentials are required. We will guide you through all writing assignments. We hope to get a wide variety of backgrounds, ages, and levels of experience in our sessions.<BR><BR>

<B>What is the registration deadline for The Freestyle Writing Workshop?</B><BR><BR>

The deadline for registration and payment is November 16, 2003.    The Freestyle Writing Workshop begins on November 17, 2003.<BR><BR>

<B>Do I have to use my regular LitKicks membername?</B><BR><BR>

No.  If you use a membername on LitKicks, we would prefer that you use the same name in the workshop and in The QUEST.  But you are welcome to create a new membername to use for the Freestyle Writing Workshop.<BR><BR>

<B>Do I have to reveal my real name or address?</B><BR><BR>

We recommend that you provide your real name and the town/city, state/province and country where you live, but this is not required. If we choose to feature your work on the site, you may wish others to know who you are. We will not reveal your email address, and we will not ask for your street address or telephone number.<BR><BR>

<B>How does the Freestyle Writing Workshop work?</B><BR><BR>

Once you're logged into the Freestyle Writing Workshop area, you will be on a shared page where you and your other group members can introduce yourselves, post messages, ask questions and post comments on each other's work.  On this page, you will see your membername and group name just under the welcome message. Please read through the brief introduction and guidelines so you are familiar with the way the Freestyle Writing Workshop will run. We've also provided a few pages about the practice of spontaneous writing, which is a good way to break through writer's block. Once you've read the guidelines and familiarized yourself with the Freestyle Writing Workshop environment, you'll be ready to read the current challenge, which will be linked at the bottom of the page.<BR><BR>

There will be approximately 7-10 members in your group.  Each member of a group will be expected to thoughtfully critique the work of the other members, and the Workshop guides may lead discussions in your group as needed. <BR><BR>

<B>Do the Workshop moderators read what is happening?</B><BR><BR>

Yes, the three moderators (Levi Asher, Jamelah Earle and Caryn Thurman) will be active and involved in the workshop area. If there are problems, we will probably be aware of it and will take action.<BR><BR>

<B>How do I post my work?</B><BR><BR>

To post your assignments, log into the Freestyle Writing Workshop and go to your group page. Post your writing by clicking the Post Your Own Work Now link at the bottom of the discussion area. Please post only one piece per assignment and start a new post (not a reply) to post your work. <BR><BR>

<B>How do I reply to others, and how do I critique another person's writing?</B><BR><BR>

You do not need special qualifications to let a writer know how you feel about his or her work. A writer wants to communicate with strangers -- that is the purpose of writing -- and you are a stranger who can tell each writer whether or not they successfully communicated with you. Did you understand the work's purpose or message? Did it make you feel good, or feel bad, or laugh or cry? What suggestions do you have to make the writing work better?<BR><BR>

<B>What is the Schedule for the Freestyle Writing Workshop?</B><BR><BR>

We will begin on November 17, 2003 and end on December 31, 2003.  We understand that these are holiday months and will schedule around the major holidays.<BR><BR>

<B>What if I don't want to critique other people's work?</B><BR><BR>

We feel that critique and feedback are important to all writers, not only for the writer receiving the feedback, but also for the writer giving it.    We find that you often learn a lot about your own writing by carefully examining other works and understanding how they work (or don’t work).   Since feedback and critique is a vital part of the workshop experience, we do ask that all participants put a good amount of effort into critiquing others’ work.<BR><BR>

<B>Do I have to write something for each assignment?</B><BR><BR>

It's recommended that you write something for each of the assignments, so that you will gain the most you can from the experience. The assignments are designed to complement each other and provide an overall wide sweep over many different types of writing. <BR><BR>

<B>Who writes the assignments?</B><BR><BR>

The assignments and guides for The Freestyle Writing Workshop are written and produced by the LitKicks Staff who will also serve as facilitators for the Workshop.<BR><BR>

<B>How long should the writings be?</B><BR><BR>

Please be considerate of the fact that your other group members may not have time to read long works, and keep your writings brief. Poems should be no longer than 40 lines, and prose should be no longer than 1000 words. These are not hard limits (you can write a poem with 60 lines or a story with 1500 words) but we hope you will do your best to avoid unnecessary length. You can use a word count feature in most writing programs (such as MS Word) to find your word count. <BR><BR>

<B>What kind of writing are you looking for?</B><BR><BR>

We're looking for short, fresh, spontaneous work. You will have time to edit, but due to the fast nature of The Freestyle Writing Workshop, we expect that pieces might be a little rough around the edges. We're looking for writings that convey ideas powerfully, rather than the most perfectly polished, refined work.<BR><BR>

<B>Why is there an entry fee?</B><BR><BR>

The $20 entry fee allows anyone who signs up to participate in these workshop sessions. The purpose of this entry fee is to support the workshop so it can be as good as it can possibly be, and also to support the operation of the site in general. We feel strongly that anybody who pays this entry fee will get their money's worth, and in fact we are aiming to present the kind of intensive workshop experience that writers might pay $300 or $400 for elsewhere.<BR><BR>

<B>How does PayPal work with international currency?</B><BR><BR>

PayPal will automatically convert foreign currency into American currency for you. For more information about this, please see <A HREF="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_help-ext&eloc=431&unique_id=1947&source_page=_home&flow=">this page</A>.<BR><BR>
