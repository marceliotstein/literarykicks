    We are proud to announce the six writers who won The QUEST, an experimental literary workshop tournament that ran during October 2003.  One hundred and fourteen writers participated in The Quest and we'd like to thank them all for their amazing work and great spirit.  The six featured writers are:<br><BR>

          Elizabeth grew up in a steeltown which she romanticizes--now that she's long gone. She studied drawing/sculpture and somehow manages to hold down a job in Ohio that allows her to use a bit of both. She collects epitaphs and changes her own periodically. Currently, she's running with "HERE LIES ELIZABETH. SHE ALWAYS WANTED MORE". <BR><BR>

          "I live in southern Pennsylvania with my two sons, my girlfriend Julie Horne, who is also a writer, and our two dogs. Been writing for as long as I can remember. One of my first memories is getting the stink eye for writing a story about a Santa Claus who dies in someone’s chimney and starts to stink up the place. I think I was about 10 at the time. Went to college in Buffalo, NY and learned all about the writers i didnt ever want to be. Toyed with journalism and advertising, but decided journalism is too misleading, and soon realized that advertising didn't want me. I’ve written several short stories and one novel, which I’m shopping to agents. I’m a frequent lurker slash poster on Litkicks, and I’m excited about being included among the better writers in the place."<BR><BR>

          Rachel has been writing stories and journaling since she was six.  Her previous works include two self-published novellas from third and fifth grade: The Day Mushi and I Turned Eight, a tale of a girl with a hungry but charming gift-eating pet elephant, and What Do You Do When No One Cares, a heart-wrenching saga of a child who runs away from home and flees across the country to find peace with foster parents in California; as well as poetry in several school literary magazines.  Well, two. Summer lives in Virginia with eighty-five adults and fifteen children on a funny, funny farm, where, when she isn't writing, she can be found making hammocks, playing guitar and singing, eating tofu, and berating herself for not doing laundry. The LitKicks anthology will be her first published work attached to an ISBN.  She's currently at work on her first novel.<BR><BR>

          The words ‘Kreddible Trout’ were hatched in a gibberish poem about a being who simply lived as one with all. The moniker was adopted out of a desire for artistic anonymity moments before his first poetry reading on May 3, 2000. The persona has thrived on a balanced diet of crypticism, optimism and brazen sobriety. Born in Montreal under another name in October 1971, his travels have brought him to almost every town in Canada in every variety of vehicle and vessel. A couple of years ago at a poetry reading in Vancouver he struck gold and fell in big love with the woman who recently became his wife. They now reside happily in Halifax with their coffee pot ‘Perky’. <BR><BR>
