In October 2003, LitKicks will choose six outstanding new writers of fiction, poetry or memoir.  These writers will be featured on the LitKicks front page and published in an upcoming book.  The QUEST is the unique community process that will lead to this selection.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2"><I>It's more than a contest.</I></FONT></CENTER><BR>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;The QUEST is an exploration, a journey, a shared experience.  It's LitKicks taken to a new level -- a four-week passage through a series of writing experiments, conducted in small, intensive groups.  It's designed to provoke reactions, uncover hidden truths and lead you to a new understanding of your own identity as a writer.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;It's something like a tournament, a survival challenge.  A new writing assignment will be issued each week.  Your goal is to write short and powerful responses that will engage and captivate other readers.  After three weekly assignments, the most successful writers within each group will advance to the final round.<br><br>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;It's something like a writing workshop. Winning is not the only point.  Your writings will be thoughtfully critiqued in a supportive and sympathetic environment.<BR><BR>

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;It's something like a poetry slam. The weekly challenges are designed to ensure freshness and spontaneity. We do not want writers to rely on familiar formulas or hand in stale, tired work. Our process is designed to move fast, break through boundaries and take both readers and writers by surprise.<br><br> 

<img src="questbutton3.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's something like a guided tour through an unknown land ... your own personality. The process is designed to inspire new ways of thinking, help you discover styles and formats you have never tried, and lead you to understand how others view your writing skills and talents.<br><br>

The QUEST will begin on LitKicks.com on October 1, 2003. The entry fee is $20. The QUEST is designed to appeal to both serious, experienced writers and interested beginners.  No writing or publishing credentials are required.  Entrants are encouraged to participate as both writers and jurors, but you may opt to participate solely as a writer or juror if you wish.<br><br>

The QUEST is LitKicks Extreme ... LitKicks on a Mission ... LitKicks Code Red. Whatever you call it, it will be an experience to remember.

<IMG WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=27 SRC="questhow.gif" ALT="How THE QUEST Works"><BR>
Unlike other writing contests, The QUEST will inspire each writer to create completely new works (short pieces of fiction, poetry and memoir) for review.  Each week, a new set of guidelines will be issued.  Responses to each assignment are due within one week.<BR><BR>
Writings will be critiqued by fellow writers and jurors within small groups.  Due to the short duration of each writing period, the criteria should emphasize power and passion, rather than polish and perfection.<BR><BR>
After three weeks, the most notable writers from each group will participate in  the final round.  Various "Honorable Mention" awards may also be given. <BR><BR>
The QUEST is the first writing contest designed around the principles of spontaneous writing.  It's going to move fast.  It's going to challenge you. It's going to be a lot of fun.  <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/questJoin.jsp">Ready?</A><BR><BR>
