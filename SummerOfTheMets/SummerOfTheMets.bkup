Chris Blomberg, a solitary 15 year old from Long
Island, has two strikes against him.  He is 
pathologically shy, barely able to speak outside 
his home.  And he has an abusive best friend, Brian, 
who uses this fact to manipulate and control him.<P>

Lianne Fahey is a tough-talking small-town girl
from upstate New York.  She changes her clothes
and her eye color several times a day, and fears
nothing but the possibility of her own boredom.<P>

<P><I>The Summer of the Mets</I> takes place in
suburban America, mid-1980's.
Ronald Reagan is in the White House, Sammy Hagar is in
Van Halen, and the New York Mets are about to
make it into the World Series.  In the midst of it all,
two talented but troubled kids are trying to fall
in love without getting too badly hurt.</P>
