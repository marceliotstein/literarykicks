<I>The Summer of the Mets</I> is a story 
about two troubled 15-year-olds
who try to fall in love.<P>

Lianne Fahey is a tough-talking small town girl who
expresses herself sometimes in art, and sometimes in
sudden acts of self-destructive behavior.  She changes 
her clothes and eye color several times a day and her 
mind nearly as often, and seems to fear nothing but
the possibility of her own boredom.  <P>

Chris Blomberg suffers from pathological shyness, and 
lives in complete social isolation in his upscale
Long Island town.  Victimized for years by a cruel best 
friend, he finally breaks away and ventures out into
the world, only to fall blindly into the confusing 
whirlpool of first-time love.<P>

The setting is suburban America, mid-1980's.
Ronald Reagan is in the White House, Sammy Hagar is in
Van Halen, and the New York Mets are in the World Series.  
In the midst of it all, two lonely kids are reaching 
out to each other and trying not to get too badly hurt.</P>
