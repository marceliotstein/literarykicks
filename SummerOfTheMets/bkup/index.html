Return to the faraway world of suburban America, mid-1980's.  
Ronald Reagan is in the White House, Sammy Hagar is in Van Halen, 
and the Mets are in the World Series.  In the midst of it all,
two troubled 15-year-olds are trying to fall in love.<P>

Meet Lianne Fahey, a tough-talking small town girl who
expresses herself sometimes in art, and sometimes in
sudden acts of self-destructive behavior.  She changes 
her clothes and eye color several times a day and her 
mind nearly as often, and seems to fear nothing but
the possibility of her own boredom.  <P>

Meet Chris Blomberg, a desperately lonely boy who leaves his
upscale Long Island town in a last-chance attempt to break
past his disabling shyness and become accepted as a "regular
person".<P>

Lianne and Chris find each other, but the explosive emotions
they uncover cannot be easily contained.  <I>The Summer of 
the Mets</I> is an honest and heartbreaking story of 
self-discovery, loss and love - the kind of love that sneaks up
and changes you forever.<P>
