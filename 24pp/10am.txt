<h3>10 a.m.</h3>
father somewhat mends, and<br>
i take my reason with a grin and a smile<br>
carrying all my cheap stuff in my coat<br>
kidnapped stories & pulsating air<br>
keep my crippled mind company, <br>
and i, a mere laugh among groans, a wink of bliss<br>
(but not the chuckle cantankerous)<br>
floating on the tempermental breeze that smacks the shutters wide<br>
looming on horizons many may fail<br>
god exists but he has myriad nicknames, and<br>
would have invented ways to pale<br>
in a million years you'll never get me<br>
among coal mines and mill towns, but we<br>
really do flutter despite a dark sky<br>
watching them die, i can no longer gloat<br>
i stand in the highway, wearing bright colours<br>
the heat makes my skin tear<br>
i am inconsistancy afloat<br>
scribing identity will always fail<br>
let me be or take me to jail<br>
beyond jazz<BR>
your sunken toes awail<BR>
alas until the might of night entails<BR>
a laugh among groans, a wink of bliss<BR>
a moat around your stalwart obsession<BR>
a joke intent on rowdy intention<BR>
<H3>11 am</H3>
keep ya mind open<BR>
monopoly has a jail<BR>
i ride a goat to work<BR>
i got kidnapped stories for you<BR>
and pulsating air<BR>
sparkles, sharp borders, blanks<BR>
i am a cactus<BR>
i am wigs<BR>
i am the fishboy waterfall, the pugdog membrane<BR>
i am a married, divorced, deadbeat dad<BR>
a man of honor and integrity<BR>
i do what I can <BR>
i dream of serenity<BR>
i am a breakdown in a lame town<BR>
a tent show gypsy with a medicine wheel<BR>
a fast slow mother with an achilles heel<BR>
a mad ass hatter with an empty pail<BR>
i'm a long time coming on the cyclone sail<BR>
i mother the motherless over and over<BR>
i hate myself and then play red rover<BR>
i'm a fistful of wet river clay <BR>
my mother didn't graduate but fed me words<BR>
i am an aging poet, a nurse, old<BR>
a grandmother alone in a sea of golden light<BR>
I stand in the highway wearing bright colors<BR>
i am unbottled glitter<BR>
a poem out of synch<BR>
nothing but words i wrote<BR>
a half note on the wrong score<BR>
tension unleashed<BR>
i sell words<BR>
a year ago i tried a gymnastic trick<BR>
i'm a writer whose liquid paper went stale<BR>
i am the first branch <BR>
of the tallest tree <BR>
in our backyard <BR>
sunrise trainyard<BR>
nature seems ready, but i am not <BR>
