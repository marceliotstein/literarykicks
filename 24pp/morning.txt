a blur of fantastic visions 
gives way to mundane images
through the leaves,
a glimmer of light -- 
faint murmurs shine clearer than
my faded windowpane: there are people passing,
hurriedly poking holes in the morning
and pinning it back in place
with their wire frame smiles.
all the little ants are caught in their paths
i am reborn 
pretending
metamorphosis of fog and skyline
these objects so brilliant
(glassonglass stressballs)
all things are well in place
but the unknown awaits me, and
the tarnished mirror distorts
an inherent sadness that clings about my eyes
i cry every time i hear an alarm clock

i am not the same person at dawn
hiding behind closed eyes
and lies, natural lenses enhance my sight 
see over the foreground of petty blight 
and into the large unknown 
tear yesterday's page out
of the notebook
window slit
a cup of coffee
if i could
i would embrace the day
taste its trips
while cups get warm
a room can make a man 
where there was none before
but a newspaper can break a spirit
i won't let it break me
what waits for me outside
cannot be good
but we're snug
like a bug 
in a fucking rug
and war is nothing 
but a big group hug
