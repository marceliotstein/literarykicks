<h3>10 p.m.</h3>
i thought i was connected once<br>
i don't remember<br>
bare feet<br>
a week without rain<br>
there was a question<br>
that nature never asked<br>
wash it away with water<br>
or with a new leaf<br>
for a new day<br>
(who knows what speck a day might be?<br>
probably all the rock specimens<br>
i've been collecting along the way)<br>
there's no respite for dirty tears<br>
or the truth of rand-mcnally<br>
bricked in<br>
or let out<br>
a window slit<br>
prophetic puddles,<br>
like morning sliding laughing diving into<br>
a stream flowing or the texture of moss<br>
in spaces between neurons, at the scale of molecules<br>
where all the green <br>
reminds me to grow,<br>
just as the benevolent superman of the sun can touch<br>
but never burn<br>
the unconditional love of a<br>
young child<br>
looking forever<br>
away<br>
when we tiptoe in blurs<br>
of moving too fast.<br>






<h3>11 p.m.</h3>
cosmic debris <br>
over and on me<br>
like hives & clusters of moons,<br>
bees upon magnificent flowers<br>
gold dust & platinum particles<br>
enriching the youth of air<br>
my goldfish make no distinction between<br>
real and unreal<br>
each <br>
part an antidote to the other<br>
alone among conscious beats <br>
in this heat right along and strong<br>
i become <br>
some inexpensive drywall<br>
in the hurricane of stars<br>
or i'm one hundred percent on a blue planet<br>
which spins and moves around the sun.<br>
sparks of it used to exist in me<br>
and with these dazed and deliberate movements,<br>
i eat earth and spit out trees<br>
like newest spring,<br>
i can smell rain.<br>
and if i run and stay with the river<br>
then there would be something missing<br>
while the blades of grass rise above me like skyscrapers<br>
