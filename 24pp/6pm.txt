<H3>6pm</H3>

cell-phoned people with a boardroom gaze<BR>
and corporate-hearted spite<BR>
there are wars within wars <BR>
the world is cruel, beautiful and glorious <BR>
but there is a light that makes the fight <BR>
sometimes i cry at night<BR>
because we're always right by night<BR>
ignite fight after fight<BR>
those sticky stories<BR>
the repetitions <BR>
the politicians with or without sound<BR>
the alarm clocks at morning<BR>
i cry every time i try <BR>
but anger is a luxury i cannot afford <BR>
little words trickle in the middle of the day<BR>
escalating into shouts of dismay<BR>
like a poem i constantly recite<BR>
like a princess with a magic kite<BR>
come what may<BR>
right of way<BR>
the very part of thee<BR>
words at play<BR>
the very heart of me<BR>
this burnin', got me churnin'<BR>
today<BR>
break-a-day that is<BR>
where it's gotta be <BR>
alight <BR>
alight <BR>
alight <BR>
public demonstrations of demeaning by day,<BR>
always <BR>
right by night<BR>
ignite <BR>
fight after fight<BR>
those sticky stories<BR>
the repetitions<BR> 
politicians <BR>
without sound<BR>
sons and daughters <BR>
who are they? <BR>
Who heeds their rights?<BR>
weigh down<BR>
convey<BR>
all the souls <BR>
that i survey<BR>
the box they sent me in<BR>
was sealed just right<BR>
with bubblewrap and tape<BR>
and not air-tight<BR>
i smile and took<BR>
a bite of my toast<BR>
love is cheap i mumbled<BR>
why not give in<BR>
give up and make the most<BR>
yeah<BR>
give it up<BR>
there’s nothing to fight<BR>
nothing to fight<BR>
nothing but me<BR>
nothing but me<BR>
just me<BR>

<H3>7pm</H3>

in a chinese restaurant you have to pay<BR>
even if the fortune cookie says, "you are my sunshine and my light"<BR> 
derek got into his stretch limo<BR>
with the tinted glass<BR>
to keep the world at bay<BR>
he didn’t see the minimum wage video store clerk<BR>
he missed the bag lady with the rusty cart<BR>
bite no real on clang <BR>
grace to its night<BR>
what we ignite we do betray<BR>
with our fear, by what we say<BR>
by how we bow our heads and pray<BR>
the ceremony is<BR>
a lie<BR>
we sway in sacred rhythm, play<BR>
we were the crimson priests and they<BR>
those who obey in raptured fright<BR>
the prey that shall be <BR>
burning bright<BR>
a thirty-foot jesus <BR>
in a ghost robe<BR>
letting slip one righteous ray<BR>
faithless and undying <BR>
the night <BR>
now <BR>
is away<BR>
restless hours<BR>
i dream and i lay <BR>
whenever he leaves<BR>
I think over and over<BR>
just hit me<BR>
just hit me<BR>
just hit me<BR>
I'd rather fight<BR>
face to face<BR>
than spend an hour<BR>
waiting <BR>
i could twist into the quilt, deny the day,<BR>
fake illness, and come out smiling in the night<BR>
i could hide the things I built, and throw away<BR>
the things for which I once put up a fight<BR>
i could let my anger linger in a box of battered tin<BR>
attach it like post-it note to silence<BR>
i could barricade my anger and let no man come in<BR>
prepare myself for love<BR>
for pleas<BR>
for violence<BR>
hopeless trips<BR>
trippy day<BR>
off flights way<BR>
come to stand another day<BR>
a world missing parts unknown<BR>
burning blood of broken bone<BR>
we as kites against the wind<BR>
we as boats against the tide<BR>
a world in a world's part<BR>
called insane by the clock of pain<BR>
night comes with burning might<BR>
to play the stage another day<BR>
songs of light in darkend ray<BR>
spinning ticks of clocks time<BR>
changing pulse of forever rhyme <BR>
