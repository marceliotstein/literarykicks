<H3>8 pm</H3>

carved to the enumerated nights <BR>
these elite licks of self vindication <BR>
sitting in the alibaster raincoat <BR>
speaking light, guttural, and meek<BR>
when i'm gone too long<BR>
the piano<BR>
out of tune<BR>
every key is wrong<BR>
out of tune<BR>
broken strings<BR>
sound like shouting<BR>
from the next apartment<BR>
out of tune<BR>
finally, after years of fighting <BR>
bitterly i lay tracks wayward, set my sights<BR>
toward becoming my own mother<BR>
hopeless trips<BR>
of flights way<BR>
come to stand another day<BR>
a world missing parts unknown<BR>
burning blood of broken bone<BR>
we as kites against the wind<BR>
we as boats against the tide<BR>
a world in a worlds part<BR>
magicians in the art of punctuating life with a fight<BR>
if you prefer the night, if you think a dream<BR>
would set it right, please shut your eyes and repeat<BR>
the pledge of allegiance -- while the candles flicker<BR>
on coal-tar bought from third-world countries<BR>
at rock-bottom prices -- and when you've finished<BR>
praying, thank god for the gift of sight, <BR>
and then thank him again for everything you'll never see<BR>
my anger is slow as rust<BR>
in my bowed skull a black flag holds sway<BR>
the wind, or is it a whisper, seems to say:<BR>
sharpen your tongue, prepare for the fray<BR>
no fire of holy sacrifice<BR>
lights us on our way to write<BR>
beyond the word the banished night<BR>
beyond what we incite<BR>
the truth<BR>
