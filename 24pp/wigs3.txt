colonel mustard mustache, caribbean eyes 
fat french toast and 500 rummy
swimming and meditating
ingénue woman, sophisticate child
bouquets alive, somberly grow
around this fallen human
to glance upward into the sky
but no western star met eye
just darkness
i fell face first flat 
on slick surface abandon,
handed the man my ticket
took seat number 3D
watched time suspend through windows weeping, 
and when the runway became as little as a line,
i counted seconds
pedro, are you gone? 
only to be found in the wind and stars of the night
who invented separation? who created terminals?
a certain knopfler riff, piano sound, the shape of a lyric 
it pulls you to mind and I wonder where you are 
this day, a day of poetry, when I would love to hear you sing
I remember and I never let that memory slip away
A blog told by a world soul full of funk and fury
yet flavor none left on your tongue
faked you out and made you fall
for the pretty lies i told
just once i wish i could see
what it is i missed before
milk skinny throwing rocks off south docks
a death for a clown -- of course you drowned
you forgot and so will I 
sanity 
found solely
 through needles or Jesus
this I call life
and live it
in death, slow, shallow breaths 
noise of want
as dawn folds
a father's hope and longing
you come back through this dust, this air, 
this time, this nothing, this always
a name
and the truth of personality
but what made the name a name 
is going into hiding
