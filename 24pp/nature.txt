<H3>9 p.m.</H3>

the rain is purple here<br>
more smoke than liquid.<br>
after a nighttime battle between thunderheads and stars<br>
water striders play jesus<br>
and brown wet mud <br>
in the garden<br>
fertilizes my toes <br>
splitting open my red letter days. <br>
i believe that i will belong to you there<br>
enamored, crazed with wind and hailstones,<br>
the flutter of delicate green<br>
camouflage eyes,<br>
clove cigarettes, diaper rash,<br>
boot camp, mathematics,<br>
weeping willow branches,<br>
television glare,<br>
points and picas.<br>
i will fall upwards toward the eternal<br>
getting lost in the colors<br>
that run too fast for speed<br>
or pointillism upon the<br>
shivering decapitation<br>
of these sun golden hours<br>
(i feel myself<br>
giving way beneath<br>
my own weight<br>
eating ocean waves,<br>
slipping through the blades of grass like mischief)<br>
i might be a careening molecule,<br>
for all i know.<br>
nature rhymes me,<br>
colliding spokes in kaleidocope<br>
fragments of light in spherical line --<br>
there is beauty in decay.<br>
i take the size of winter, splinter it into my palm,<br>
the exquisite tension of a violin string<br>
being drawn<br>
a bell <br>
rings<br>
into silence<br>
nothing brings it further in<br>
than god,<br>
a nite lite in eternity.<br>
