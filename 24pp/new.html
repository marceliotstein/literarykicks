<H3>Death and War</H3>
<I>by Eliot Katz</I><BR>
<BR> 
On the last car of a late night N train<BR>
I asked Death how it managed<BR>
    to move so quickly<BR>
        during wars.<BR>
 <BR>
"I'm not sure why," Death answered,<BR>
"but ever since Hiroshima<BR>
    my skates glide faster<BR>
        over the cool Earth."<BR>
 <BR>
I asked whether it was possible<BR>
to tell the difference <BR>
    between a civilian<BR>
        and a young draftee.<BR>
 <BR>
"No difference."<BR>
 <BR>
I said from my own perspective<BR>
there was at least something different<BR>
    about a playful child<BR>
        struck by stray cluster bomb.<BR>
 <BR>
Death glared between my eyes.<BR>
 <BR>
I debated with Death about the merits<BR>
of a bullet, a car crash, & a baseball bat--<BR>
    It confessed the first case<BR>
        of pediatric AIDS <BR>
 <BR>
had almost bounced back & shocked Death<BR>
    to death.<BR>
 <BR>
Approaching the last stop, I asked <BR>
whether it ever thought, <BR>
    despite a difficult economy,<BR>
        to look for an easier job.<BR>
 <BR>
Death laughed & pointed to the front page<BR>
of today's New York Times.<BR>
    "Watch your step, E. Katz,<BR>
        but don't make it obvious."<BR>

             We're psyched to present the never-before-seen 1999 video of <A HREF="partyVideo.html">John Cassady at the Bitter End</A>.  It's a long 77MB download (don't even try it over a modem) but, if you can get it, it's worth it.  We'd like anybody who downloads it to freely share it with others, so if you don't get a chance to see it now we hope you'll have a chance at some later time.  All video download links will only be available during the course of this 24 hour event.<BR><BR>
