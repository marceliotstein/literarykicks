        <I>Welcome to the LitKicks 24 Hour Poetry Party.  We asked poet provacateur Bob Holman for a contribution, and he sent this moving remembrance of lost friends.  Bob Holman was the poet responsible for bringing poetry slams to New York City (after they'd been invented in Chicago) and is known as a hardworking and dedicated advocate for the diverse spirit of modern alternative literature.</I><BR><BR>
<H3>Night of the Living Dead Every Day</H3>
<I>by Bob Holman</I><BR><BR>

<ul>		<i>Help Me
		  I Can See</i>

Pedro Juan Pietri Aponte and Spalding Gray <BR>
and me<BR>
are in a room marked No Exit. They are just dead <BR>
together in me (age 56 today, living). Sartre says Pedro <BR>
Bunuel continues Spalding, The Exterminating Angel<BR>
Braque and Picasso I<BR>
am quick<BR>
to add.  The triangulation <BR>
my dear dead friends and I<BR>
the third who walks beside, the third man,<BR>
earth man.<BR>
One dies in water, one dies in air<BR>
I walk the earth fair who cares <BR>
it is spring again, I wonder<BR>
why, as James Schuyler once said <BR>
wrote to no one<BR>
in particular and always<BR>
Pedro's ironic birthday<BR>
3/21/44 first day of spring of, a poet<BR>
who became a poet<BR>
when he failed miserably<BR>
as an undertaker<BR>
died March 2<BR>
or 3 round midnight<BR>
twixt time zones<BR>
to die on two days<BR>
Mexico to US<BR>
twixt two cultures<BR>
on his way to 60.
<BR><BR>
What can I say<BR>
write? Swimming<BR>
with Spalding upstream to Green<BR>
Point, the icy flow and corduroy<BR>
ferrying home. You can't<BR>
sleep with the fishes cause<BR>
the fishes don't sleep as Nick<BR>
Jones says<BR>
sings. He's a good swimmer<BR>
even with his dragging foot <BR>
and head plate, pulls me along<BR>
to shore where we rest for a while.
<BR><BR>
The doors and windows of Romero<BR>
open in one direction but they open <BR>
and the zombies are everywhere.  Pedro
<BR><BR>
is hooting and Spalding is dancing and <BR>
I am writing it down down like time sinks.<BR>
Good line says Pedro who can rhyme<BR>
sublime with sublime and love with<BR>
what the fuck. Spalding is pattering <BR>
and patering, this is their first meeting<BR>
and now we are here forever someone mentions (ok, me)<BR>
trying to make the lines that add<BR>
up not <BR>
down.
<BR><BR>
Only I am breathing. Awfully<BR>
parochial says my man Spalding<BR>
Pedro is sleeping Speedo<BR>
I can't sleep says Spalding remembering everything
<BR><BR>
In Speedo's dream is life all over<BR>
but never again<BR>
never all over again<BR>
we'd worship all afternoon <BR>
at the altar in the Men's Shelter<BR>
dice and rice and cheap red wine <BR>
and Spalding says the word Happiness<BR>
we are all touched as zombies<BR>
scale the walls to the 38th floor<BR>
busting in as the room breathes<BR>
axes in the windows they are singing<BR>
Happy Birthday to me, surprise, and<BR>
the words are Auld Lang Syne<BR><BR>
