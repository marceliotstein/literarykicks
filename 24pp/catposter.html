   Dear Honored Guest:<BR><BR>
   Would you please take a few minutes to "donate a question" to the LitKicks 24 HOUR POETRY PARTY?<BR><BR>  
   This real-time event will bring tens of thousands of readers and writers from all over the world together in a riotous burst of poetic collaboration.  For 24 hours, we will ask participants to compose spontaneous verse in response to a fast-moving series of questions, koans and multimedia stimuli.<BR><BR>
   We are showing you this preview page because we would be honored to include a simple contribution from you in our itinerary for this event.  Here's what we're looking for:<BR><BR>
   &#8226;&nbsp;a controversial question about a topical issue (e.g. "has war become a form of reality tv?")<BR><BR>
   &#8226;&nbsp;a provocative question of a personal nature ("what is the truest love you have ever felt?")<BR><BR>
   &#8226;&nbsp;a writing challenge (e.g. "write four lines of iambic pentameter describing the room you're in right now")<BR><BR>
   &#8226;&nbsp;an original "koan" (a puzzling utterance or observation designed to produce enlightenment)<BR><BR>
   &#8226;&nbsp;any other type of question, statement, phrase or quotation designed to inspire the poetic spirit<BR><BR>
   We are hoping to include contributions from notable poets who represent the diversity of today's literary scene, including contemporary academic poetry, hiphop and spoken word, postmodernism and surrealism, beat and underground poetry and the international scene.<BR><BR>  
   It would mean a lot to us if you would send us a few words by email to <A HREF="mailto:brooklyn@litkicks.com"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFBF">brooklyn@litkicks.com</FONT></A>.  Please respond by June 30 if possible.  Thank you!<BR><BR>
