<i>Poet Robert Creeley sent us this poem, a realization of aging, written with a gentle clarity.  Robert Creeley has been known as a Black Mountain Poet, and he has further distinguished himself as a professor and as Poet Laureate of New York State.  We're pleased to bring his work to you.</i><br><br>  


Faded in face of apparent reality –<br>

As it comes, I see it still goes on and on.<br>

and even now still sitting at this table <br>

is the smiling man who nobody seems to know. <br><br>



Older, the walls apparently get higher.<br>

No one seemingly gets to look over<br>

to see the people pointing at the sky<br>

where the old planes used to fly over. <br><br>



I packed my own reality in a bag <br>

and pushed it under the table,<br>

thinking to retrieve it when able<br>

some time bye and bye.<br><br>

             We're psyched to present the never-before-seen 1999 video of <A HREF="partyVideo.html">John Cassady at the Bitter End</A>.  It's a long 77MB download (don't even try it over a modem) but, if you can get it, it's worth it.  We'd like anybody who downloads it to freely share it with others, so if you don't get a chance to see it now we hope you'll have a chance at some later time.  All video download links will only be available during the course of this 24 hour event.<BR><BR>
