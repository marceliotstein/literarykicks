
tightly writing 
loosely thinking 
like a junebug 
hovering
an inflatable pool raft and several 
centuries crackle beneath her sunburnt skin
pictures of her
in blue bikini and shimmer-bottle
"that's you at fifty" he elbowed
"this is me without you" i thought
and just yesterday, she reminded me
that i am not my body
nor those thoughts which chain me
which battered my eardrums 
in waves of salt spray
tidal bore, nineteen seventy-seven
black ace secret six temple of man
a gentle hand with the word
and the best corner man
any up and comer
could ever hope to have
erupted on the surface of the sun
scrambling all radio transmission
to bring us the music
proving it true
i miss you
I miss you like a broken link
no bandage 
can mend 
the loss 
of you
state lines and lifetimes 
away from me
chords strike me down
magnet to me
world now in different hues
voice just out of town
Wrapping me in riffs 
sown by leadbelly’s ghost
cushions of air
jump off the detroit-superior bridge
in suspended animation 
over cuyahoga waters 
there are times 
when a soul strikes a path
days past, ontario,
on superior, on st. clair,
on payne, on chester,
on prospect, on euclid,
in a row of millionaires
names 
written on a black granite wall 
knew some
yet somehow i miss them all
but i forgot the sound of your return
busy humming with the faucet drips
he seemed to breathe back in response to me
as though we were in bed and I had sighed
i am thinking today, you upset me
being gone as you are, i miss you
still mad at the thought 
that you could leave me
to all who i learned from carrying grace
friendship and in-jokes, all fell into place
the lessons i learned not to make no mistakes
your end-time was sure you did enough on earth
shall I move to hawai'i and dance with the gods
i am not sorry for looking to the past
these shards of crockery are the archaeology 
of wistful remembering, our makeshift memory
.. and yet i can see, as if in a dream
my grandfather, young as i never knew him
at the reins of a cutter on a frozen lake 
i can't say enough how water heals
