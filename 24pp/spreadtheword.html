   Please help us spread the word about the LitKicks 24 Hour 
   Poetry Party.  We want this to be the biggest and best online 
   party in the history of the universe, and to do this we need to 
   reach as many people as we can. <BR><BR>

   Do you know anybody who works for a newspaper, magazine, radio station or tv station?  Please ask them to announce our gathering.  Do you know of anybody who runs an arts calendar, a blog or an email newsletter?  Every little bit helps.<BR><BR>

   We are especially interested in reaching people from faraway places and foreign countries.  We're calling this the 24 Hour Poetry Party because we want to party in every time zone on the planet.  But even in today's networked world, there are some regions we can't easily reach, and if you can help in any way we'd really appreciate it.<BR><BR>

   Another way you can help is to print as many copies of our poster as you can and put them up anywhere you find a blank wall -- libraries, bookstores, student centers, music stores, coffee shops, mailboxes, lampposts ... it's all good.<BR><BR>

   The poster is designed to print well on any printer -- color, black-and-white, inkjet or laser.  If you can help, here's what to do:<BR><BR>

   1. Wait until the image to the right is fully 
   visible on your screen.  This is a high-resolution printable image.<BR><BR>
   2. Save the image to your local drive 
   (right mouse-click on a PC, or 
   control/mouse-click on a Mac).<BR><BR>
   3. Open the the image in any standard 
   viewing program such as Paint,    Image Viewer, Microsoft Word or Adobe 
   Photoshop (Note: the poster will NOT print 
   correctly from Internet Explorer or most other web browsers).<BR><BR>
   4. Print as many copies as you wish and put them up using either scotch tape, glue or thumbtacks.  <BR><BR>

   A larger view of the image is available below on this page.<BR><BR>

   Thanks for helping to get the word out ... 
   and don't forget to come to the party on LitKicks.com 
   on July 23-24 yourself!  See you there.<BR><BR>
