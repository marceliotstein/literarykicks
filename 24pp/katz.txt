Death and War
 
On the last car of a late night N train
I asked Death how it managed
    to move so quickly
        during wars.
 
"I'm not sure why," Death answered,
"but ever since Hiroshima
    my skates glide faster
        over the cool Earth."
 
I asked whether it was possible
to tell the difference 
    between a civilian
        and a young draftee.
 
"No difference."
 
I said from my own perspective
there was at least something different
    about a playful child
        struck by stray cluster bomb.
 
Death glared between my eyes.
 
I debated with Death about the merits
of a bullet, a car crash, & a baseball bat--
    It confessed the first case
        of pediatric AIDS 
 
had almost bounced back & shocked Death
    to death.
 
Approaching the last stop, I asked 
whether it ever thought, 
    despite a difficult economy,
        to look for an easier job.
 
Death laughed & pointed to the front page
of today's New York Times.
    "Watch your step, E. Katz,
        but don't make it obvious."
