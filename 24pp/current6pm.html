<H3>4 pm</H3>
tightly writing <BR>
loosely thinking <BR>
like a junebug <BR>
hovering<BR>
an inflatable pool raft and several <BR>
centuries crackle beneath her sunburnt skin<BR>
pictures of her<BR>
in blue bikini and shimmer-bottle<BR>
"that's you at fifty" he elbowed<BR>
"this is me without you" i thought<BR>
and just yesterday, she reminded me<BR>
that i am not my body<BR>
nor those thoughts which chain me<BR>
which battered my eardrums <BR>
in waves of salt spray<BR>
tidal bore, nineteen seventy-seven<BR>
black ace secret six temple of man<BR>
a gentle hand with the word<BR>
and the best corner man<BR>
any up and comer<BR>
could ever hope to have<BR>
erupted on the surface of the sun<BR>
scrambling all radio transmission<BR>
to bring us the music<BR>
proving it true<BR>
i miss you<BR>
i miss you like a broken link<BR>
no bandage <BR>
can mend <BR>
the loss <BR>
of you<BR>
state lines and lifetimes <BR>
away from me<BR>
chords strike me down<BR>
magnet to me<BR>
world now in different hues<BR>
voice just out of town<BR>
Wrapping me in riffs <BR>
sown by leadbelly's ghost<BR>
cushions of air<BR>
jump off the detroit-superior bridge<BR>
in suspended animation <BR>
over cuyahoga waters <BR>
there are times <BR>
when a soul strikes a path<BR>
days past, ontario,<BR>
on superior, on st. clair,<BR>
on payne, on chester,<BR>
on prospect, on euclid,<BR>
in a row of millionaires<BR>
names <BR>
written on a black granite wall <BR>
knew some<BR>
yet somehow i miss them all<BR>
but i forgot the sound of your return<BR>
busy humming with the faucet drips<BR>
he seemed to breathe back in response to me<BR>
as though we were in bed and i had sighed<BR>
i am thinking today, you upset me<BR>
being gone as you are, i miss you<BR>
still mad at the thought <BR>
that you could leave me<BR>
to all who i learned from carrying grace<BR>
friendship and in-jokes, all fell into place<BR>
the lessons i learned not to make no mistakes<BR>
your end-time was sure you did enough on earth<BR>
shall i move to hawai'i and dance with the gods<BR>
i am not sorry for looking to the past<BR>
these shards of crockery are the archaeology <BR>
of wistful remembering, our makeshift memory<BR>
.. and yet i can see, as if in a dream<BR>
my grandfather, young as i never knew him<BR>
at the reins of a cutter on a frozen lake <BR>
i can't say enough how water heals<BR>
