
awoken with the back-hoes and bulldozers again
somewhere I can sleep
somewhere I can dream
second eyelid slowly rises
amazed at glaring sunlight
get religion
kick the monkey
fall in love
write the conclusion
understand calculus
i am reborn pretendng
your fate lies in my wonder/eyes 
like children back to eden
humanity runs naked at this hour
before going out
to wait for the bus
once i followed a meandering river
and like joseph smith i met a prophet
“upon you i confer these tablets”
he said, so i ate, and i saw
it is storming outside
and loudly the wind journeys
yet insides all is calm
morning is a time for glints of light, the kind
that shatter into sheets that separate 
the warmth from the cold
the hum from the screech
the gray buzz from the yawn into the folds of light
caught in the mania
beyond the bedroom door
this grayness is a fluid 
skin and bones now grind to life
my black weight breathes
eyes push
and pull
over in the middle of the rain there
this morning, through the leaves,
a glimmer of light 
and I smelled colour and lived scents
and marveled at the clarity
by special invitation
the masquerade beckons
i open my eyes like curtains
on brown framed windows
the room looks the same
my first moment is neutral
then I focus my gelatin brain
immaculate visions of lunacy
tired of spinning 
on this cozy piece of dirt 
so we scatter the directions 
get chased up ladders and over a roof
we get away and we run some more 
almost get caught but spot a door 
it's marked "Perception"
we've passed through here before
