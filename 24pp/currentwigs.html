       <I>The following is the initial mix of the first three hours.  Thanks to all contributors so far, and please keep it rolling!</I><BR><BR>
<H3>12 noon</H3>

bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor<BR>
i am white walls<BR>
and<BR>
white floor<BR>
i am my soon, this one, adore<BR>
right now there is no rain,<BR>
the door is to the left of me<BR>
racking my brain, no shame<BR>
crack open the door<BR>
shaking off edges and thoughts<BR>
crack open the door<BR>
the dog seems happy<BR>
the rain <BR>
is falling diagonal <BR>
and i have a funeral tomorrow<BR>
could be a palace of suburbia<BR>
narrow space with junk instead<BR>
dreamings<BR>
dreamings<BR>
dreamings in the core<BR>
bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor<BR>
window slit <BR>
dried rain<BR>
computer refrain<BR>
cant complain<BR>
i see y(our) life bricked in by the windowpane<BR>
nothing left to lose, nothing more to gain<BR>
books<BR>
a party of books<BR>
poetry, anthologies<BR>
a snickety lott of books<BR>
and scalp <BR>
i am home<BR>
and fame <BR>
i am more<BR>
test it<BR>
still<BR>
and still<BR>
and one<BR>
<BR>
<H3>1 pm</H3>
orbital happiness<BR>
stellar gorgeousness, a cosmic chain<BR>
constellations<BR>
and a puddle<BR>
a puddle of rain<BR>
too rough from my hands, from other than me<BR>
no grace. nothing. nothing unfolds as it should<BR>
and it should be<BR>
i felt something like pain,<BR>
sliding out of me,<BR>
aching in my chair<BR>
meandering, not melancholy<BR>
upended books, unopened bills,<BR> 
unbidden offers sent to me, <BR>
a watch face down, a glossy photo, <BR>
no space left free<BR>
a neglected glass, dusty typewriter at an open door<BR>
an empty duffle tossed upon a hardwood floor<BR>
i feel a growling beat<BR>
i am but a stain<BR>
groping for <BR>
me<BR>
(and the rain<BR>
and the door<BR>
and a sea in a tree)<BR>
from where i sit <BR>
the view does not inspire --<BR>
papers stacked on desk, tables and floor<BR>
little time for reverie<BR>
or introspection<BR>
the job requires one to see<BR>
what is there<BR>
not to dream what could be <BR>
<H3>2 pm</H3>
factual fallacies<BR>
the roof above my head<BR>
keep the rain <BR>
and keep the dread<BR>
inane managers to abhor<BR>
photo of girlfriend I adore<BR>
writing trash<BR>
but maybe more<BR>
window slit <BR>
dried rain<BR>
my desk is cluttered and causes me pain<BR>
my excuses I use <BR>
truly are poor<BR>
what is there<BR>
not to dream <BR>
what could be <BR>
what is not there<BR>
dared to be <BR>
all <BR>
all<BR>
all <BR>
tears<BR>
and queers<BR>
and quietness<BR>
and whores<BR>
coming through my door<BR>
coming through this mess<BR>
in my mind<BR>
begging, begging<BR>
begging<BR>
for<BR>
more<BR>
staring out upon a parking lot<BR>
i am but a stain<BR>
this asphalt is hot<BR>
time holds me green and dying<BR>
i can only hope i'll find a door<BR>
tree green whispers<BR>
and pebbles in holy streams<BR>
too rough from my hands<BR>
nothing unfolds as it should<BR>
i'm begging<BR>
still <BR>
i'm begging<BR>
for more<BR>

             In the spirit of <A HREF="holman.html">this poem by Bob Holman</A>, we'd like you to write about somebody you miss, or somebody you wish to remember.<BR><BR>
             Please try to write ONLY in lines of eight to fourteen syllables.
This is essential for the rhythm we are trying to establish for this section
of the poem.  Please pay attention to the meter of your lines to make sure
they flow smoothly.  For example, Shakespeare's phrase:<BR><BR>
"<I>a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing</I>"<BR><BR>
is a smooth series of "iambs", or matched syllables.  A different type of rhythm (using "trochees", which are backwards iambs) is established when Gary Snyder writes:<BR><BR>
<I>"Cedar planking, wooden bucket, water-splashing"</I><BR><BR>
Please give us long lines (no less than eight syllables per line) that flow simply and easily. <BR><BR>

             We will create a composite poem from all the responses.  Please write quickly and honestly.  To submit your words, click this button:<BR>
