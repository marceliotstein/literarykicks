3am 

softly spoken, broken
asked of myself in silence
filmy golden streetlight
listening to the sound
boots make on the floor
-- contact --
love commands 
duties ignore
every ounce of myself 
that was a vagabond love 
and still the door shuts silent 
we know the flesh, bone and shake 
pulled both ways 

<h3>4 a.m.</h3>
i'm sitting and wondering<br>
what it's like to take a chance<br>
what it's like to draw circles through<br>
the zippers of contemplation <br>
while geometry argues<br>
with algebraic variables <br>
an alarm goes off inside the fog<br>
cracked scattered seeds<br>
i do this with a smile on my face<br>
i do this where the dark binds hard on the edges, and<br>
the price of love is negligible<br>
when i'm collecting defeat<br>
in piles ordered neatly<br>
against the edge<br>
of the brick wall<br>
where i rest my head<br>
and listen to the way<br>
absence whispers<br>
into brass tubas, genetically re-engineered<br> 
to mimic cellos in october<br>
likely to pass with a night's rest,<br>
dissipate with adequate distraction,<br>
(brain is the hate of a snake<br>
that hasn't ever bitten)<br>
between the lines<br>
that cut through nails, claw through<br>
pink, and crack the ice<br>
when voices collide:<br>
everything will slip<br>
nothing can be held<br>
and i say<br> 
so long, love,<br>
off into the peoria night<br>
where i appear on your doorstep<br>
melting<br>
my head spirals upward<br><br>
