<H3>Night of the Living Dead Every Day</H3>
<I>by Bob Holman</I><BR><BR>

<ul>		<i>“Help Me
		  I Can See”</i>
		--sign on Pedro’s begging can</ul>
				 

Pedro Juan Pietri Aponte and Spalding Gray <BR>
and me<BR>
are in a room marked No Exit. They are just dead <BR>
together in me (age 56 today, living). Sartre says Pedro <BR>
Buñuel continues Spalding, The Exterminating Angel<BR>
Braque and Picasso I<BR>
am quick<BR>
to add.  The triangulation <BR>
my dear dead friends and I<BR>
the third who walks beside, the third man,<BR>
earth man.<BR>
One dies in water, one dies in air<BR>
I walk the earth fair who cares <BR>
“It is spring again, I wonder<BR>
why,” as James Schuyler once said <BR>
wrote to no one<BR>
in particular and always<BR>
Pedro’s ironic birthday<BR>
3/21/44 first day of spring of, a poet<BR>
who became a poet<BR>
when he failed miserably<BR>
as an undertaker<BR>
died March 2<BR>
or 3 round midnight<BR>
twixt time zones<BR>
to die on two days<BR>
Mexico to US<BR>
twixt two cultures<BR>
on his way to 60.
<BR><BR>
What can I say<BR>
write? Swimming<BR>
with Spalding upstream to Green<BR>
Point, the icy flow and corduroy<BR>
ferrying home. You can’t<BR>
sleep with the fishes cause<BR>
the fishes don’t sleep as Nick<BR>
Jones says<BR>
sings. He’s a good swimmer<BR>
even with his dragging foot <BR>
and head plate, pulls me along<BR>
to shore where we rest for a while.
<BR><BR>
The doors and windows of Romero<BR>
open in one direction but they open <BR>
and the zombies are everywhere.  Pedro
<BR><BR>
is hooting and Spalding is dancing and <BR>
I am writing it down down like time sinks.<BR>
Good line says Pedro who can rhyme<BR>
sublime with sublime and love with<BR>
what the fuck. Spalding is pattering <BR>
and patering, this is their first meeting<BR>
and now we are here forever someone mentions (ok, me)<BR>
trying to make the lines that add<BR>
up not <BR>
down.
<BR><BR>
Only I am breathing. Awfully<BR>
parochial says my man Spalding<BR>
Pedro is sleeping Speedo<BR>
I can’t sleep says Spalding remembering everything
<BR><BR>
In Speedo’s dream is life all over<BR>
but never again<BR>
never all over again<BR>
we’d worship all afternoon <BR>
at the altar in the Men’s Shelter<BR>
dice and rice and cheap red wine <BR>
and Spalding says the word Happiness<BR>
we are all touched as zombies<BR>
scale the walls to the 38th floor<BR>
busting in as the room breathes<BR>
axes in the windows they are singing<BR>
Happy Birthday to me, surprise, and<BR>
the words are Auld Lang Syne<BR><BR>
