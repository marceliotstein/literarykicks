

a room can make a man where there is none
so i clothe myself in air
spike windows with a wooden crutch
up high, up high
on the pitter patter stone
red prim facets of dress 
i am the son of irishmen 
i know nothing of my father's father 
but I know his cigarettes 
i know his hands 
i know the hot beds of where he had been 
i know the empty wine bottles and laughter 
through trials and vices 
i know his cigarettes 
siamese question marks joined at the curiosity
we were transformed
our footprints
intrepid sleuths
orbiting obscure electrons
ragtag regiment
blame laid on lack of vision, superstition
heiroglyphic malintention
the pages of my book flew away, chasing your smile 
a smile like a hero
that buffalo bob captain america smile
like I saw on TV 
and then I saw
it was me
the yang approach 
when others cringe in yin
the wild distance 
haunts the ocean’s spread
aloft 
aloft on lonely rafts
in a sour, sour
seizure of expression
when leading lovers cross the slick dance floor,
no one but you personifies the devil anymore
and i'm forgotten
me
me
rotten bitten
a piece of fruit that tasted good
within today and yesterday i've lost myself
in missing you, wishing you
empty, nothing
fantasies of dying
been missin' most of everything
for better than three decades now
you did not say much 
when i leapt into the sky
every twist and turn of my learning boy-skull
the guitar sat in the corner like a memory
and you leaned in and told me about hong kong,
the heroin, the magazine strapped to your leg
the size of the centipedes, the size of the cell
and i wasn't like you
i could not smile
or deeply philosophise the sad engines
what a pairing, what a coming-together we were
long hair, short hair, long mind, short mind
ya see 
I was drivin' home
runnin red lights
my time in the realm
of the charmed
missing you, wishing you
been missin' most of everything
for better
than three decades 
now
