<H3>12 midnight</H3> 

this love story begins <BR>
with a daisy chain <BR>
fitted to a tender wrist <BR>
contour stretching to the confines of<BR>
the moon, low and fat<BR>
like an overripe melon<BR>
moving forward in the rain -- <BR>
this journey does not end<BR>
with meeting you downtown in a dream on the train<BR>
(i knew from your clothes that this trip would be right<BR>
i'm digging the trap and the fuck and the fight)<BR>
my way of loving is to live by <BR>
narrowing the focus like thickets along the window panes<BR>
of who i am inside, or the sacrifices we make<BR>
to carry this rush of life into bright sunlight,<BR>
and hold it sacred, away from the dust of night.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>1am</H3>

november made its promises, so i became your shore<BR>
eroding wordlessly beneath your approach and retreat<BR>
staying just enough to remind you, if you might<BR>
remember the places where i wait.<BR>
and you said that you'd try<BR>
and I said that i'd fight<BR>
but what might become of two bodies in rain<BR>
breathing it in and breaking the chain<BR>
i long to touch my fingertips<BR>
to your neck, your back or arm<BR>
hear your breath softly<BR>
escape from your parted lips<BR>
(louder still are my thoughts<BR>
to grab you hard around your hips)<BR>
your raven hair coiled like mine<BR>
wanting the wet and the heat and the pain<BR>
simple isn't something that can contain<BR>
the night, growing heavy with memory and longing,<BR>
winding against the sky, in a jealous refrain.<BR><BR>

<H3>2am</H3>

fragments. one looks like the moon<BR>
otherwise, pigments. churches. semi-<BR>
holy stones. Someones eyes cross<BR>
in rows or paths where hearts are as<BR>
common as watches, ticking thcikly<BR>
as morning empies fire into<BR>
the night. hollow atrocities<BR>
grow heavy with memory and longing<BR>
i still remember the bloodstain<BR>
his dead body left on the floor<BR>
it was obscene, a sorry sight<BR>
i wonder<BR>
if he can hear into me<BR>
love me please love me,<BR>
alone in the night<BR>
i'm singing in my sleep<BR>
we're<BR>
spending separate nights<BR>
sighing eyes<BR>
countless tries<BR>
believing lies<BR>
pinpoint the start of our downfall<BR>
and i will tell you why<BR>
you stopped caring, no more calls<BR>
nobody moved when i cried <BR>
