<h3>5 a.m.</h3>
parking softly at the stoplight<br>
singing gently to the moonlight<br>
tap tapping on the dashboard<br>
fondling the seat cover<br>
shouting a single line:<br>
“you are your mother”<br>
(johnny cash<br>
waxedachumo)<br>
rakes for the handless man,<br>
and a mouth flooded with glue<br>
circles in the room, wondering where<br>
there will be time to breathe.<br>
hearing the weight of screams<br>
emanating from a device:<br>
still a piece of<br>
human beauty<br>
trouble crushes between my eyes<br>
(my brain hasn't finished congealing.)<br>
failing an answer<br>
filling our mornings<br>
with the terrible death of food.<br>




<h3>6 a.m.</h3>
lashing myself<br>
to an orange thought<br>
i cannot find my step, my track<br>
my feet are lost in a huge stack<br>
of dying grass. and while i pass <br>
this wondrous way i plug my ears and pace <br>
working the clear life down the tube<br>
at no why time all, they're<br>
telling us to do things,<br>
to do voodoo things,<br>
and grin<br>
at ragged thoughts of slices of life<br>
(he put out his cigarette<br>
in a knot on his wooden right leg<br>
if he's deaf and cannot hear<br>
then we'll bury the sleeping ear)<br>
the night swears<br>
its revenge,<br>
assures us it<br>
will come again<br>
to release us<br>
from our sanity<br>
and i wonder<br>
when will i get back home<br>
into a swaying lukewarm sea.<br><br>
