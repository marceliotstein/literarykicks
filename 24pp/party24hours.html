<I>We did it!  Here's our poem.</I><BR><BR>
<H3>12 noon</H3>

bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor<BR>
i am white walls<BR>
and<BR>
white floor<BR>
i am my soon, this one, adore<BR>
right now there is no rain,<BR>
the door is to the left of me<BR>
racking my brain, no shame<BR>
crack open the door<BR>
shaking off edges and thoughts<BR>
crack open the door<BR>
the dog seems happy<BR>
the rain <BR>
is falling diagonal <BR>
and i have a funeral tomorrow<BR>
could be a palace of suburbia<BR>
narrow space with junk instead<BR>
dreamings<BR>
dreamings<BR>
dreamings in the core<BR>
bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor<BR>
window slit <BR>
dried rain<BR>
computer refrain<BR>
cant complain<BR>
i see y(our) life bricked in by the windowpane<BR>
nothing left to lose, nothing more to gain<BR>
books<BR>
a party of books<BR>
poetry, anthologies<BR>
a snickety lott of books<BR>
and scalp <BR>
i am home<BR>
and fame <BR>
i am more<BR>
test it<BR>
still<BR>
and still<BR>
and one<BR>
<BR>
<H3>1 pm</H3>
orbital happiness<BR>
stellar gorgeousness, a cosmic chain<BR>
constellations<BR>
and a puddle<BR>
a puddle of rain<BR>
too rough from my hands, from other than me<BR>
no grace. nothing. nothing unfolds as it should<BR>
and it should be<BR>
i felt something like pain,<BR>
sliding out of me,<BR>
aching in my chair<BR>
meandering, not melancholy<BR>
upended books, unopened bills,<BR> 
unbidden offers sent to me, <BR>
a watch face down, a glossy photo, <BR>
no space left free<BR>
a neglected glass, dusty typewriter at an open door<BR>
an empty duffle tossed upon a hardwood floor<BR>
i feel a growling beat<BR>
i am but a stain<BR>
groping for <BR>
me<BR>
(and the rain<BR>
and the door<BR>
and a sea in a tree)<BR>
from where i sit <BR>
the view does not inspire --<BR>
papers stacked on desk, tables and floor<BR>
little time for reverie<BR>
or introspection<BR>
the job requires one to see<BR>
what is there<BR>
not to dream what could be <BR>
<H3>2 pm</H3>
factual fallacies<BR>
the roof above my head<BR>
keep the rain <BR>
and keep the dread<BR>
inane managers to abhor<BR>
photo of girlfriend i adore<BR>
writing trash<BR>
but maybe more<BR>
window slit <BR>
dried rain<BR>
my desk is cluttered and causes me pain<BR>
my excuses i use <BR>
truly are poor<BR>
what is there<BR>
not to dream <BR>
what could be <BR>
what is not there<BR>
dared to be <BR>
all <BR>
all<BR>
all <BR>
tears<BR>
and queers<BR>
and quietness<BR>
and whores<BR>
coming through my door<BR>
coming through this mess<BR>
in my mind<BR>
begging, begging<BR>
begging<BR>
for<BR>
more<BR>
staring out upon a parking lot<BR>
i am but a stain<BR>
this asphalt is hot<BR>
time holds me green and dying<BR>
i can only hope i'll find a door<BR>
tree green whispers<BR>
and pebbles in holy streams<BR>
too rough from my hands<BR>
nothing unfolds as it should<BR>
i'm begging<BR>
still <BR>
i'm begging<BR>
for more<BR>

<H3>3 pm</H3>

a room can make a man where there is none<BR>
so i clothe myself in air<BR>
spike windows with a wooden crutch<BR>
up high, up high<BR>
on the pitter patter stone<BR>
red prim facets of dress <BR>
i am the son of irishmen <BR>
i know nothing of my father's father <BR>
but i know his cigarettes <BR>
i know his hands <BR>
i know the hot beds of where he had been <BR>
i know the empty wine bottles and laughter <BR>
through trials and vices <BR>
i know his cigarettes <BR>
siamese question marks joined at the curiosity<BR>
we were transformed<BR>
our footprints<BR>
intrepid sleuths<BR>
orbiting obscure electrons<BR>
ragtag regiment<BR>
blame laid on lack of vision, superstition<BR>
heiroglyphic malintention<BR>
the pages of my book flew away, chasing your smile <BR>
a smile like a hero<BR>
that buffalo bob captain america smile<BR>
like i saw on TV <BR>
and then i saw<BR>
it was me<BR>
the yang approach <BR>
when others cringe in yin<BR>
the wild distance <BR>
haunts the ocean's spread<BR>
aloft <BR>
aloft on lonely rafts<BR>
in a sour, sour<BR>
seizure of expression<BR>
when leading lovers cross the slick dance floor<BR>
no one but you personifies the devil anymore<BR>
and i'm forgotten<BR>
me<BR>
me<BR>
rotten bitten<BR>
a piece of fruit that tasted good<BR>
within today and yesterday i've lost myself<BR>
in missing you, wishing you<BR>
empty, nothing<BR>
fantasies of dying<BR>
been missin' most of everything<BR>
for better than three decades now<BR>
you did not say much <BR>
when i leapt into the sky<BR>
every twist and turn of my learning boy-skull<BR>
the guitar sat in the corner like a memory<BR>
and you leaned in and told me about hong kong,<BR>
the heroin, the magazine strapped to your leg<BR>
the size of the centipedes, the size of the cell<BR>
and i wasn't like you<BR>
i could not smile<BR>
or deeply philosophise the sad engines<BR>
what a pairing, what a coming-together we were<BR>
long hair, short hair, long mind, short mind<BR>
ya see <BR>
i was drivin' home<BR>
runnin' red lights<BR>
my time in the realm<BR>
of the charmed<BR>
missing you, wishing you'd<BR>
been missin' most of everything<BR>
for better<BR>
than three decades <BR>
now<BR>
<BR>
<H3>4 pm</H3>
tightly writing <BR>
loosely thinking <BR>
like a junebug <BR>
hovering<BR>
an inflatable pool raft and several <BR>
centuries crackle beneath her sunburnt skin<BR>
pictures of her<BR>
in blue bikini and shimmer-bottle<BR>
"that's you at fifty" he elbowed<BR>
"this is me without you" i thought<BR>
and just yesterday, she reminded me<BR>
that i am not my body<BR>
nor those thoughts which chain me<BR>
which battered my eardrums <BR>
in waves of salt spray<BR>
tidal bore, nineteen seventy-seven<BR>
black ace secret six temple of man<BR>
a gentle hand with the word<BR>
and the best corner man<BR>
any up and comer<BR>
could ever hope to have<BR>
erupted on the surface of the sun<BR>
scrambling all radio transmission<BR>
to bring us the music<BR>
proving it true<BR>
i miss you<BR>
i miss you like a broken link<BR>
no bandage <BR>
can mend <BR>
the loss <BR>
of you<BR>
state lines and lifetimes <BR>
away from me<BR>
chords strike me down<BR>
magnet to me<BR>
world now in different hues<BR>
voice just out of town<BR>
Wrapping me in riffs <BR>
sown by leadbelly's ghost<BR>
cushions of air<BR>
jump off the detroit-superior bridge<BR>
in suspended animation <BR>
over cuyahoga waters <BR>
there are times <BR>
when a soul strikes a path<BR>
days past, ontario,<BR>
on superior, on st. clair,<BR>
on payne, on chester,<BR>
on prospect, on euclid,<BR>
in a row of millionaires<BR>
names <BR>
written on a black granite wall <BR>
knew some<BR>
yet somehow i miss them all<BR>
but i forgot the sound of your return<BR>
busy humming with the faucet drips<BR>
he seemed to breathe back in response to me<BR>
as though we were in bed and i had sighed<BR>
i am thinking today, you upset me<BR>
being gone as you are, i miss you<BR>
still mad at the thought <BR>
that you could leave me<BR>
to all who i learned from carrying grace<BR>
friendship and in-jokes, all fell into place<BR>
the lessons i learned not to make no mistakes<BR>
your end-time was sure you did enough on earth<BR>
shall i move to hawai'i and dance with the gods<BR>
i am not sorry for looking to the past<BR>
these shards of crockery are the archaeology <BR>
of wistful remembering, our makeshift memory<BR>
.. and yet i can see, as if in a dream<BR>
my grandfather, young as i never knew him<BR>
at the reins of a cutter on a frozen lake <BR>
i can't say enough how water heals<BR>
<H3>5 pm</H3>
colonel mustard mustache, caribbean eyes <BR>
fat french toast and 500 rummy<BR>
swimming and meditating<BR>
ingenue woman, sophisticate child<BR>
bouquets alive, somberly grow<BR>
around this fallen human<BR>
to glance upward into the sky<BR>
but no western star met eye<BR>
just darkness<BR>
i fell face first flat<BR>
on slick surface abandon,<BR>
handed the man my ticket<BR>
took seat number 3D<BR>
watched time suspend through windows weeping, <BR>
and when the runway became as little as a line,<BR>
i counted seconds<BR>
pedro, are you gone? <BR>
only to be found in the wind and stars of the night<BR>
who invented separation? who created terminals?<BR>
a certain knopfler riff, piano sound, the shape of a lyric <BR>
it pulls you to mind and i wonder where you are <BR>
this day, a day of poetry, when i would love to hear you sing<BR>
i remember and i never let that memory slip away<BR>
a blog told by a world soul full of funk and fury<BR>
yet flavor none left on your tongue<BR>
faked you out and made you fall<BR>
for the pretty lies i told<BR>
just once i wish i could see<BR>
what it is i missed before<BR>
milk skinny throwing rocks off south docks<BR>
a death for a clown -- of course you drowned<BR>
you forgot and so will i <BR>
sanity <BR>
found solely<BR>
 through needles or jesus<BR>
this i call life<BR>
and live it<BR>
in death, slow, shallow breaths <BR>
noise of want<BR>
as dawn folds<BR>
a father's hope and longing<BR>
you come back through this dust, this air, <BR>
this time, this nothing, this always<BR>
a name<BR>
and the truth of personality<BR>
but what made the name a name <BR>
is going into hiding<BR>
<BR>
<H3>6pm</H3>
cell-phoned people with a boardroom gaze<BR>
and corporate-hearted spite<BR>
there are wars within wars <BR>
the world is cruel, beautiful and glorious <BR>
but there is a light that makes the fight <BR>
sometimes i cry at night<BR>
because we're always right by night<BR>
ignite fight after fight<BR>
those sticky stories<BR>
the repetitions <BR>
the politicians with or without sound<BR>
the alarm clocks at morning<BR>
i cry every time i try <BR>
but anger is a luxury i cannot afford <BR>
little words trickle in the middle of the day<BR>
escalating into shouts of dismay<BR>
like a poem i constantly recite<BR>
like a princess with a magic kite<BR>
come what may<BR>
right of way<BR>
the very part of thee<BR>
words at play<BR>
the very heart of me<BR>
this burnin', got me churnin'<BR>
today<BR>
break-a-day that is<BR>
where it's gotta be <BR>
alight <BR>
alight <BR>
alight <BR>
public demonstrations of demeaning by day,<BR>
always <BR>
right by night<BR>
ignite <BR>
fight after fight<BR>
those sticky stories<BR>
the repetitions<BR> 
politicians <BR>
without sound<BR>
sons and daughters <BR>
who are they? <BR>
Who heeds their rights?<BR>
weigh down<BR>
convey<BR>
all the souls <BR>
that i survey<BR>
the box they sent me in<BR>
was sealed just right<BR>
with bubblewrap and tape<BR>
and not air-tight<BR>
i smile and took<BR>
a bite of my toast<BR>
love is cheap i mumbled<BR>
why not give in<BR>
give up and make the most<BR>
yeah<BR>
give it up<BR>
there's nothing to fight<BR>
nothing to fight<BR>
nothing but me<BR>
nothing but me<BR>
just me<BR>
<BR>
<H3>7pm</H3>
in a chinese restaurant you have to pay<BR>
even if the fortune cookie says, "you are my sunshine and my light"<BR> 
derek got into his stretch limo<BR>
with the tinted glass<BR>
to keep the world at bay<BR>
he didn't see the minimum wage video store clerk<BR>
he missed the bag lady with the rusty cart<BR>
bite no real on clang <BR>
grace to its night<BR>
what we ignite we do betray<BR>
with our fear, by what we say<BR>
by how we bow our heads and pray<BR>
the ceremony is<BR>
a lie<BR>
we sway in sacred rhythm, play<BR>
we were the crimson priests and they<BR>
those who obey in raptured fright<BR>
the prey that shall be <BR>
burning bright<BR>
a thirty-foot jesus <BR>
in a ghost robe<BR>
letting slip one righteous ray<BR>
faithless and undying <BR>
the night <BR>
now <BR>
is away<BR>
restless hours<BR>
i dream and i lay <BR>
whenever he leaves<BR>
I think over and over<BR>
just hit me<BR>
just hit me<BR>
just hit me<BR>
I'd rather fight<BR>
face to face<BR>
than spend an hour<BR>
waiting <BR>
i could twist into the quilt, deny the day,<BR>
fake illness, and come out smiling in the night<BR>
i could hide the things I built, and throw away<BR>
the things for which I once put up a fight<BR>
i could let my anger linger in a box of battered tin<BR>
attach it like post-it note to silence<BR>
i could barricade my anger and let no man come in<BR>
prepare myself for love<BR>
for pleas<BR>
for violence<BR>
hopeless trips<BR>
trippy day<BR>
off flights way<BR>
come to stand another day<BR>
a world missing parts unknown<BR>
burning blood of broken bone<BR>
we as kites against the wind<BR>
we as boats against the tide<BR>
a world in a world's part<BR>
called insane by the clock of pain<BR>
night comes with burning might<BR>
to play the stage another day<BR>
songs of light in darkend ray<BR>
spinning ticks of clocks time<BR>
changing pulse of forever rhyme <BR>
<BR>
<H3>8 pm</H3>

carved to the enumerated nights <BR>
these elite licks of self vindication <BR>
sitting in the alibaster raincoat <BR>
speaking light, guttural, and meek<BR>
when i'm gone too long<BR>
the piano<BR>
out of tune<BR>
every key is wrong<BR>
out of tune<BR>
broken strings<BR>
sound like shouting<BR>
from the next apartment<BR>
out of tune<BR>
finally, after years of fighting <BR>
bitterly i lay tracks wayward, set my sights<BR>
toward becoming my own mother<BR>
hopeless trips<BR>
of flights way<BR>
come to stand another day<BR>
a world missing parts unknown<BR>
burning blood of broken bone<BR>
we as kites against the wind<BR>
we as boats against the tide<BR>
a world in a worlds part<BR>
magicians in the art of punctuating life with a fight<BR>
if you prefer the night, if you think a dream<BR>
would set it right, please shut your eyes and repeat<BR>
the pledge of allegiance -- while the candles flicker<BR>
on coal-tar bought from third-world countries<BR>
at rock-bottom prices -- and when you've finished<BR>
praying, thank god for the gift of sight, <BR>
and then thank him again for everything you'll never see<BR>
my anger is slow as rust<BR>
in my bowed skull a black flag holds sway<BR>
the wind, or is it a whisper, seems to say:<BR>
sharpen your tongue, prepare for the fray<BR>
no fire of holy sacrifice<BR>
lights us on our way to write<BR>
beyond the word the banished night<BR>
beyond what we incite<BR>
the truth<BR>
<BR>
<H3>9 p.m.</H3>

the rain is purple here<br>
more smoke than liquid.<br>
after a nighttime battle between thunderheads and stars<br>
water striders play jesus<br>
and brown wet mud <br>
in the garden<br>
fertilizes my toes <br>
splitting open my red letter days. <br>
i believe that i will belong to you there<br>
enamored, crazed with wind and hailstones,<br>
the flutter of delicate green<br>
camouflage eyes,<br>
clove cigarettes, diaper rash,<br>
boot camp, mathematics,<br>
weeping willow branches,<br>
television glare,<br>
points and picas.<br>
i will fall upwards toward the eternal<br>
getting lost in the colors<br>
that run too fast for speed<br>
or pointillism upon the<br>
shivering decapitation<br>
of these sun golden hours<br>
(i feel myself<br>
giving way beneath<br>
my own weight<br>
eating ocean waves,<br>
slipping through the blades of grass like mischief)<br>
i might be a careening molecule,<br>
for all i know.<br>
nature rhymes me,<br>
colliding spokes in kaleidocope<br>
fragments of light in spherical line --<br>
there is beauty in decay.<br>
i take the size of winter, splinter it into my palm,<br>
the exquisite tension of a violin string<br>
being drawn<br>
a bell <br>
rings<br>
into silence<br>
nothing brings it further in<br>
than god,<br>
a nite lite in eternity.<br>
<br>
<h3>10 p.m.</h3>

i thought i was connected once<br>
i don't remember<br>
bare feet<br>
a week without rain<br>
there was a question<br>
that nature never asked<br>
wash it away with water<br>
or with a new leaf<br>
for a new day<br>
(who knows what speck a day might be?<br>
probably all the rock specimens<br>
i've been collecting along the way)<br>
there's no respite for dirty tears<br>
or the truth of rand-mcnally<br>
bricked in<br>
or let out<br>
a window slit<br>
prophetic puddles,<br>
like morning sliding laughing diving into<br>
a stream flowing or the texture of moss<br>
in spaces between neurons, at the scale of molecules<br>
where all the green <br>
reminds me to grow,<br>
just as the benevolent superman of the sun can touch<br>
but never burn<br>
the unconditional love of a<br>
young child<br>
looking forever<br>
away<br>
when we tiptoe in blurs<br>
of moving too fast.<br>
<br>
<h3>11 p.m.</h3>

cosmic debris <br>
over and on me<br>
like hives & clusters of moons,<br>
bees upon magnificent flowers<br>
gold dust & platinum particles<br>
enriching the youth of air<br>
my goldfish make no distinction between<br>
real and unreal<br>
each <br>
part an antidote to the other<br>
alone among conscious beats <br>
in this heat right along and strong<br>
i become <br>
some inexpensive drywall<br>
in the hurricane of stars<br>
or i'm one hundred percent on a blue planet<br>
which spins and moves around the sun.<br>
sparks of it used to exist in me<br>
and with these dazed and deliberate movements,<br>
i eat earth and spit out trees<br>
like newest spring,<br>
i can smell rain.<br>
and if i run and stay with the river<br>
then there would be something missing<br>
while the blades of grass rise above me like skyscrapers<br>

<BR> 

<H3>12 midnight</H3> 
through pub air heavy with noisy smoke<br>
a love story begins<BR>
outside, blank nighttime streets<BR>
the moon, low and fat<BR>
like an overripe melon<BR>
moving forward in the rain<BR>
i'm meeting you downtown on the train<BR>
(i knew from your clothes that this trip would be right<BR>
i'm digging the trap and the fuck and the fight)<BR>
this is my recipe for fresh<br>
with each misstep<BR>
each fight, each stumble<br>
my way of loving is to lose<BR>
narrowing the focus of my life<br>
like thickets along the window panes<BR>
i choke<br>
this is who i am<br>
and the sacrifices i make<BR>
define my boundaries and my walls<br>
pinpoint the start of our downfall<br>
find it<br>
that exact spot<br>
and i will tell you why<br>
carry<br>
this rush of life into bright sunlight,<BR>
hold it sacred<BR>
it's what we have left to hold on to<BR>
<BR>
<H3>1 am</H3>

november made its promises, and i became your shore<BR>
eroding wordlessly beneath your approach and retreat<BR>
staying just enough to remind you that you said you'd try<BR>
and I said that i'd fight<BR>
even though i long to touch my fingertips<br>
to your neck or back or arm<BR>
hear your breath softly<BR>
escape from your parted lips<BR>
my thoughts are louder than<BR>
your raven hair coiled like mine<BR>
wanting the wet and the heat and the pain<BR>
simple isn't something that can contain<BR>
the night, growing heavy with memory and longing,<BR>
winding against the sky in a jealous refrain.<BR><BR>

<H3>2 am</H3>

fragments. one looks like the moon<BR>
otherwise, pigments. churches. semi-<BR>
holy stones. Someones eyes cross<BR>
in rows or paths where hearts are as<BR>
common as watches, ticking thickly<BR>
as morning empties fire into<BR>
the night. hollow atrocities<BR>
grow heavy with memory and longing<BR>
i still remember the bloodstain<BR>
his dead body left on the floor<BR>
it was obscene, a sorry sight<BR>
i wonder<BR>
if he can hear into me<BR>
love me please love me,<BR>
alone in the night<BR>
i'm singing in my sleep<BR>
we're<BR>
spending separate nights<BR>
sighing eyes<BR>
countless tries<BR>
believing lies<BR>
pinpoint the start of our downfall<BR>
and i will tell you why<BR>
nobody moved when i cried <BR>
<br>
<H3>3 am</h3>

softly spoken, broken<BR>
asked of myself in silence<BR>
filmy golden streetlight<BR>
listening to the sound<BR>
boots make on the floor<BR>
-- contact --<BR>
love commands <BR>
duties ignore<BR>
every ounce of myself <BR>
that was a vagabond love <BR>
and still the door shuts silent <BR>
we know the flesh, bone and shake <BR>
pulled both ways <BR>
<BR>
<h3>4 am</h3>

i'm sitting and wondering<br>
what it's like to take a chance<br>
what it's like to draw circles through<br>
the zippers of contemplation <br>
while geometry argues<br>
with algebraic variables <br>
an alarm goes off inside the fog<br>
cracked scattered seeds<br>
i do this with a smile on my face<br>
i do this where the dark binds hard on the edges, and<br>
the price of love is negligible<br>
when i'm collecting defeat<br>
in piles ordered neatly<br>
against the edge<br>
of the brick wall<br>
where i rest my head<br>
and listen to the way<br>
absence whispers<br>
into brass tubas, genetically re-engineered<br> 
to mimic cellos in october<br>
likely to pass with a night's rest,<br>
dissipate with adequate distraction,<br>
(brain is the hate of a snake<br>
that hasn't ever bitten)<br>
between the lines<br>
that cut through nails, claw through<br>
pink, and crack the ice<br>
when voices collide:<br>
everything will slip<br>
nothing can be held<br>
and i say<br> 
so long, love,<br>
off into the peoria night<br>
where i appear on your doorstep<br>
melting<br>
my head spirals upward<br><br>

<h3>5 am</h3>
parking softly at the stoplight<br>
singing gently to the moonlight<br>
tap tapping on the dashboard<br>
fondling the seat cover<br>
shouting a single line:<br>
"you are your mother"<br>
(johnny cash<br>
waxedachumo)<br>
rakes for the handless man,<br>
and a mouth flooded with glue<br>
circles in the room, wondering where<br>
there will be time to breathe.<br>
hearing the weight of screams<br>
emanating from a device:<br>
still a piece of<br>
human beauty<br>
trouble crushes between my eyes<br>
(my brain hasn't finished congealing.)<br>
failing an answer<br>
filling our mornings<br>
with the terrible death of food.<br>
<br>
<h3>6 am</h3>
lashing myself<br>
to an orange thought<br>
i cannot find my step, my track<br>
my feet are lost in a huge stack<br>
of dying grass. and while i pass <br>
this wondrous way i plug my ears and pace <br>
working the clear life down the tube<br>
at no why time all, they're<br>
telling us to do things,<br>
to do voodoo things,<br>
and grin<br>
at ragged thoughts of slices of life<br>
(he put out his cigarette<br>
in a knot on his wooden right leg<br>
if he's deaf and cannot hear<br>
then we'll bury the sleeping ear)<br>
the night swears<br>
its revenge,<br>
assures us it<br>
will come again<br>
to release us<br>
from our sanity<br>
and i wonder<br>
when will i get back home<br>
into a swaying lukewarm sea.<br><br>

<H3>7 am</H3>
awoken with the back-hoes and bulldozers again<BR>
somewhere I can sleep<BR>
somewhere I can dream<BR>
second eyelid slowly rises<BR>
amazed at glaring sunlight<BR>
get religion<BR>
kick the monkey<BR>
fall in love<BR>
write the conclusion<BR>
understand calculus<BR>
i am reborn pretending<BR>
your fate lies in my wonder/eyes <BR>
like children back to eden<BR>
humanity runs naked at this hour<BR>
before going out<BR>
to wait for the bus<BR>
once i followed a meandering river<BR>
and like joseph smith i met a prophet<BR>
"upon you i confer these tablets"<BR>
he said, so i ate, and i saw<BR>
it is storming outside<BR>
and loudly the wind journeys<BR>
yet inside all is calm<BR>
morning is a time for glints of light, the kind<BR>
that shatter into sheets that separate <BR>
the warmth from the cold<BR>
the hum from the screech<BR>
the gray buzz from the yawn into the folds of light<BR>
caught in the mania<BR>
beyond the bedroom door<BR>
this grayness is a fluid <BR>
skin and bones now grind to life<BR>
my black weight breathes<BR>
eyes push<BR>
and pull<BR>
over in the middle of the rain there<BR>
this morning, through the leaves,<BR>
a glimmer of light <BR>
and I smelled color and lived scents<BR>
and marveled at the clarity<BR>
by special invitation<BR>
the masquerade beckons<BR>
i open my eyes like curtains<BR>
on brown framed windows<BR>
the room looks the same<BR>
my first moment is neutral<BR>
then I focus my gelatin brain<BR>
immaculate visions of lunacy<BR>
tired of spinning <BR>
on this cozy piece of dirt <BR>
so we scatter the directions <BR>
get chased up ladders and over a roof<BR>
we get away and we run some more <BR>
almost get caught but spot a door <BR>
it's marked "perception"<BR>
we've passed through here before <BR>
<BR>
<H3>8 am</H3>
i am not the same person at dawn<BR>
hiding behind closed eyes<BR>
and lies, natural lenses enhance my sight <BR>
see over the foreground of petty blight <BR>
and into the large unknown <BR>
tear yesterday's page out<BR>
of the notebook<BR>
window slit<BR>
a cup of coffee<BR>
if i could<BR>
i would embrace the day<BR>
taste its trips<BR>
while cups get warm<BR>
a room can make a man <BR>
where there was none before<BR>
but a newspaper can break a spirit<BR>
i won't let it break me<BR>
what waits for me outside<BR>
cannot be good<BR>
but we're snug<BR>
like a bug <BR>
in a fucking rug<BR>
and war is nothing <BR>
but a big group hug<BR>
<H3>9 am</H3>
a blur of fantastic visions <BR>
gives way to mundane images<BR>
through the leaves,<BR>
a glimmer of light -- <BR>
faint murmurs shine clearer than<BR>
my faded windowpane: there are people passing,<BR>
hurriedly poking holes in the morning<BR>
and pinning it back in place<BR>
with their wire frame smiles.<BR>
all the little ants are caught in their paths<BR>
i am reborn <BR>
pretending<BR>
metamorphosis of fog and skyline<BR>
these objects so brilliant<BR>
(glassonglass stressballs)<BR>
all things are well in place<BR>
but the unknown awaits me, and<BR>
the tarnished mirror distorts<BR>
an inherent sadness that clings about my eyes<BR>
i cry every time i hear an alarm clock<BR>
<h3>10 am</h3>
father somewhat mends, and<br>
i take my reason with a grin and a smile<br>
carrying all my cheap stuff in my coat<br>
kidnapped stories & pulsating air<br>
keep my crippled mind company, <br>
and i, a mere laugh among groans, a wink of bliss<br>
(but not the chuckle cantankerous)<br>
floating on the tempermental breeze that smacks the shutters wide<br>
looming on horizons many may fail<br>
god exists but he has myriad nicknames, and<br>
would have invented ways to pale<br>
in a million years you'll never get me<br>
among coal mines and mill towns, but we<br>
really do flutter despite a dark sky<br>
watching them die, i can no longer gloat<br>
i stand in the highway, wearing bright colors<br>
the heat makes my skin tear<br>
i am inconsistancy afloat<br>
scribing identity will always fail<br>
let me be or take me to jail<br>
beyond jazz<BR>
your sunken toes awail<BR>
alas until the might of night entails<BR>
a laugh among groans, a wink of bliss<BR>
a moat around your stalwart obsession<BR>
a joke intent on rowdy intention<BR>
<H3>11 am</H3>
keep ya mind open<BR>
monopoly has a jail<BR>
i ride a goat to work<BR>
i got kidnapped stories for you<BR>
and pulsating air<BR>
sparkles, sharp borders, blanks<BR>
i am a cactus<BR>
i am wigs<BR>
i am the fishboy waterfall, the pugdog membrane<BR>
i am a married, divorced, deadbeat dad<BR>
a man of honor and integrity<BR>
i do what I can <BR>
i dream of serenity<BR>
i am a breakdown in a lame town<BR>
a tent show gypsy with a medicine wheel<BR>
a fast slow mother with an achilles heel<BR>
a mad ass hatter with an empty pail<BR>
i'm a long time coming on the cyclone sail<BR>
i mother the motherless over and over<BR>
i hate myself and then play red rover<BR>
i'm a fistful of wet river clay <BR>
my mother didn't graduate but fed me words<BR>
i am an aging poet, a nurse, old<BR>
a grandmother alone in a sea of golden light<BR>
I stand in the highway wearing bright colors<BR>
i am unbottled glitter<BR>
a poem out of synch<BR>
nothing but words i wrote<BR>
a half note on the wrong score<BR>
tension unleashed<BR>
i sell words<BR>
a year ago i tried a gymnastic trick<BR>
i'm a writer whose liquid paper went stale<BR>
i am the first branch <BR>
of the tallest tree <BR>
in our backyard <BR>
sunrise trainyard<BR>
nature seems ready, but i am not <BR>
