       <I>We're really excited to bring to you a new suite of poems by Michael McClure, who began his career as a young member of Kenneth Rexroth's San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, read with Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder at the seminal Six Gallery Poetry Reading that launched the Beat Generation poetry scene, and then began a new phase of his career as a controversial playwright in the 60's and 70's.  McClure was part of the 1967 San Francisco Be-In, co-wrote "Mercedes Benz" with Janis Joplin, and continues to write fresh, lively and relevant poetry infused with nature consciousness and textual experimentation.</I><BR>

IMMORTAL PRINCESS,<BR>
or the Bodhisattva Kannon as a simpering<BR>
and infinitely generous<BR>
OLD WHORE.<BR>

HUNGER.  HUNGRY.  HUGE CAVERNOUS  HOLE.<BR>
HOLDING TORN BEINGS IN TRANSITION.<BR>
Lives devouring the path into light<BR>
of blackness.  Inside of a cricket.<BR>
A BIG SHINING FACE WITH EYES<BR>
filling the room.  Roaming<BR>
without movement.  Searching for food<BR>
ARISING AROUND.<BR>

THIS SCIENCE IS LOVE.<BR>
The tiniest microbe<BR>
lies adjacent to the larger.<BR>
A CHUNK<BR>
feeding and receiving<BR>
in a secret ocean.<BR>
Glowing like a new bodhisattva<BR>
and an etched line by Rembrandt.<BR>
<BR>
Plain as snakes' eyes.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  F I V E</H4>

CORRUPT AND DIMPLED BY IMAGINATION.<BR>
Nothing corrupt.  Perfect as a griffon by Blake.  Corrupt<BR>
as a cloud of unknowing<BR>
visioned beneath the underside of the belly.<BR>
ME,<BR>
OUTSIDE OF IT RISING (while it rises)<BR>
INTO BEINGS WITH CORN FIELDS.<BR>
A REDWOOD FOREST.<BR>

<H4>MYSTERIOSO  S I X</H4>

PAWS.  TO ALL PAWS LIVING AND DEAD.<BR>
Nebulae glitter on claw tips by soft pink pads.<BR>
No pause to the smell of bosomy fennel<BR>
in vacant lots by crumbling<BR>
RED BRICKS<BR>
when the rain starts.<BR>
A DEER AT THE TOP OF THE HILL.<BR>
Mist and a star in his antlers.<BR>
I am here without paws.  Searching<BR>
for the trillion billion senses.<BR>

dream destinies<BR>

<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  S E V E N</H4>

SENSE.  SENSE OF THE CANDLE'S LIGHT.<BR>
SILVERY GLOW.  FEATHERY STAR OF THE HALO.<BR>
Sparks flicker the fingertips.  Field of creatures<BR>
nestled on the tongue.  The nose.  The fern.<BR>
<BR>
Feel the real muscular animal power.<BR>
The sense of haunches and wrists is reason.<BR>
Reason is non sense draped<BR>
in velvet of senses<BR>
AND WHISKERS<BR>
and blood streaming veins.<BR>
Blind till caution is shattered<BR>
like a wind shield.<BR>

<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  ( ( A ) )</H4>

BUILD.  BUILD BOLD LOVING ARMS.<BR>
Build new love.  Over and over.<BR>
Boulders on the sea shore.<BR>
Build with the fecal smell of the final wreckage<BR>
and roaring smoking destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Morph the feared and debased<BR>
into luxury<BR>
OF CONSCIOUSNESS<BR>
as<BR>
a microbe<BR>
on a wet boot sole<BR>
in a movie theater<BR>
creates the energy of stars.<BR>
<BR>
NOW<BR>
WE<BR>
ARE<BR>
EAGLES<BR>
in the realm of eagles' wings.<BR>
(NOW WE ARE AUTOMATONS<BR>
of reductionist technology. )<BR>
BUILD LIFE.  BUILD DEATH.  FREE OF THE WHEEL.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  (( B ))  </H4>

STAND.  UNDERSTAND.  STAND PAT ON THE SENSES.<BR>
THE EYE SEES MORE<BR>
than the heart knows.<BR>
Stand up in the peace horrors<BR>
and decadent war.<BR>
Admit the deep power<BR>
and<BR>
your love<BR>
of torture.<BR>
THE TEASING OF FLESH.<BR>
<BR>
Say, this too is a shape of love<BR>
before love.<BR>
Now it is time to choose:<BR>
"NO!<BR>
NO, TO THE HIDEOUS<BR>
LOVELINESS."<BR>
Soon I will protect<BR>
all beings<BR>
and<BR>
stand softly<BR>
with a big smile.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  E I G H T  </H4>

BLACK ARISEN TO BLACK ROSES IS VOICES<BR>
BETWEEN PETALS.<BR>
The yellow centers with anthers<BR>

E<BR>
G<BR>
I<BR>
N<BR>

WITH BLACK.<BR>
Lonely.  Sweet as honey.<BR>
Overpopulated by blossoms and petals.<BR>
Consciousness narrowly streams<BR>
like a nematode, muscularly,<BR>
between plastics and hunks<BR>
OF MANUFACTURED THOUGHT.<BR>
Through births of new hatreds<BR>
--poisonous as ever.<BR>
Greedy for ignorance<BR>
as a sitcom.<BR>
<BR>
And we stretch<BR>
in this bed<BR>
<BR>
touching shoulders<BR>
just as whales and mice<BR>
do.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  N I N E  </H4> 

FORGIVE CORE OF THE MEAT.  FORGIVE MEAT FLESH.<BR>
Forgive rage.  Also kindness.  Touch gentle<BR>
in this strange spot.<BR>
ALWAYS VISITED.  THE CORE OF ALL REALMS<BR>
--of chickadees, tadpoles, living droplets, blazing minuscule<BR>
FURNACES.<BR>
<BR>
A TRILLION BILLION<BR>
INSIDE<BR>
OF ANOTHER<BR>
LIKE AN ONION,<BR>
<BR>
spraying heavens<BR>
that intermix<BR>
<BR>
while<BR>
we<BR>
slide<BR>
through<BR>
shallow crevices.<BR>
EMOTIONS.  WATERFALLS.<BR>
&#8226;<BR>
Frozen ponds<BR>
with goldfish<BR>
alive and swimming<BR>
in the black water.<BR>
YES!  --AND MUCH MORE<BR>
<BR>
SING!<BR>

<H4>MYSTERIOSO  T E N</H4>

GREEN GRASS IN RAIN.  BLUE-GREEN EYES.<BR>
Grass calling up yellow violets.  Root<BR>
notes seethe back and forth.  Aligned<BR>
to the flash of no matter.<BR>
NADA<BR>
OF<BR>
GREEN SPRING<BR>
in midwinter.  "Spring up<BR>
green freshet." Blue-green eyes,<BR>
nourish like the storm<BR>
and horse head cliffs.<BR>
<BR>
PLIANT DIMENSIONS.<BR>
Interludes<BR>
L<BR>
A<BR>
U<BR>
G<BR>
H<BR>
while lipids turn over dancing<BR>
and thundering under deer hooves.<BR>
<BR>
A HANDFUL<BR>

<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  E L E V E N </H4>

STREAM OF FACES.  FACES ON SAND GRAINS<BR>

STREAM OF ROARING NEURON LACE,<BR>
S<BR>
I<BR>
L<BR>
E<BR>
N<BR>

Free in the preserve the soul inspires.<BR>

where the night will be star sparks.)<BR>

PLAIN RED MEAT,<BR>
PLAIN DULL THING.  STREAMING<BR>
BULK OF DELICATE HULKING IMAGINATION<BR>
VAST AND FAR LESS AND TINIER TOO.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico</I><BR>
<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  T W E L V E</H4>
ENERGY OF DARKNESS.  ENERGY OF LIGHT.<BR>
Each is a speck of the other,<BR>
hallucinations  of being,<BR>
when what matters is the interwarmth<BR>
of our eyes<BR>
IN<BR>
THIS<BR>
almost secret<BR>
place.<BR>
<BR>
Mined out of a wall of turquoise and gold<BR>
<BR>
SOFT WINGS ON OUR BROWS<BR>
ARE NOT<BR>
like the sprays of the blue-black spumes<BR>
from our foreheads.<BR>
THE NEW <BR>
BLACK COAT<BR>
is the skin of a mammal<BR>
in candle light.<BR>
<BR>
War enters on mammoth feet,<BR>
and courage and the energy of Reason respond.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>MYSTERIOSO  T H I R T E E N</H4>
SMILE.  SMILE WITH THE SOFT EDGE<BR>
OF THE MIND.<BR>
Pliant as the lip of an abalone.<BR>
Strong as the smallest worm in it's harshest<BR>
and tenderly nourishing realm.<BR>
NO MIND.  NO BODY.  GONE.  GONE.<BR>
I stroke my hands over my chest<BR>
and your buttocks<BR>
WE<BR>
SMILE<BR>
INSPIRED<BR>
by protein pleasure<BR>
and loveliness.<BR>
So solid.<BR>
We defeat presence or nothingness.<BR>
All of me and all of you<BR>
ARE<BR>
this cameo of perfection<BR>
with smooth polished edges.<BR>
<BR>
THIS<BR>
IS<BR>
REALLY IT!<BR>

             The <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/partyboard.jsp">Party Board</A> is back up.  And, we're psyched to present the never-before-seen 1999 video of <A HREF="partyVideo.html">John Cassady at the Bitter End</A>.  It's a long 77MB download (don't even try it over a modem) but, if you can get it, it's worth it.  We'd like anybody who downloads it to freely share it with others, so if you don't get a chance to see it now we hope you'll have a chance at some later time.<BR><BR>
             We think our 24 Hour poem is kicking some major poetry ass right now, and taking names.  Please <A HREF="party24hours.html">check it out here</A>, especially the 2 sections most recently added, "6 pm" and "7 pm". <BR><BR>
             The next writing challenge will begin sometime past midnight EST.
