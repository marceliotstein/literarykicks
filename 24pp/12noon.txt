bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor
i am white walls
and
white floor
i am my soon, this one, adore
right now there is no rain,
the door is to the left of me
racking my brain, no shame
crack open the door
shaking off edges and thoughts
crack open the door
the dog seems happy
the rain 
is falling diagonal 
and i have a funeral tomorrow
could be a palace of suburbia
narrow space with junk instead
dreamings
dreamings
dreamings in the core
bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor
window slit 
dried rain
computer refrain
cant complain
i see y(our) life bricked in by the windowpane
nothing left to lose, nothing more to gain
books
a party of books
poetry, anthologies
a snickety lott of books
and scalp 
i am home
and fame 
i am more
test it
still
and still
and one
