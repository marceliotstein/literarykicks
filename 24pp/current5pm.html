<H3>3 pm</H3>

a room can make a man where there is none<BR>
so i clothe myself in air<BR>
spike windows with a wooden crutch<BR>
up high, up high<BR>
on the pitter patter stone<BR>
red prim facets of dress <BR>
i am the son of irishmen <BR>
i know nothing of my father's father <BR>
but i know his cigarettes <BR>
i know his hands <BR>
i know the hot beds of where he had been <BR>
i know the empty wine bottles and laughter <BR>
through trials and vices <BR>
i know his cigarettes <BR>
siamese question marks joined at the curiosity<BR>
we were transformed<BR>
our footprints<BR>
intrepid sleuths<BR>
orbiting obscure electrons<BR>
ragtag regiment<BR>
blame laid on lack of vision, superstition<BR>
heiroglyphic malintention<BR>
the pages of my book flew away, chasing your smile <BR>
a smile like a hero<BR>
that buffalo bob captain america smile<BR>
like i saw on TV <BR>
and then i saw<BR>
it was me<BR>
the yang approach <BR>
when others cringe in yin<BR>
the wild distance <BR>
haunts the ocean's spread<BR>
aloft <BR>
aloft on lonely rafts<BR>
in a sour, sour<BR>
seizure of expression<BR>
when leading lovers cross the slick dance floor<BR>
no one but you personifies the devil anymore<BR>
and i'm forgotten<BR>
me<BR>
me<BR>
rotten bitten<BR>
a piece of fruit that tasted good<BR>
within today and yesterday i've lost myself<BR>
in missing you, wishing you<BR>
empty, nothing<BR>
fantasies of dying<BR>
been missin' most of everything<BR>
for better than three decades now<BR>
you did not say much <BR>
when i leapt into the sky<BR>
every twist and turn of my learning boy-skull<BR>
the guitar sat in the corner like a memory<BR>
and you leaned in and told me about hong kong,<BR>
the heroin, the magazine strapped to your leg<BR>
the size of the centipedes, the size of the cell<BR>
and i wasn't like you<BR>
i could not smile<BR>
or deeply philosophise the sad engines<BR>
what a pairing, what a coming-together we were<BR>
long hair, short hair, long mind, short mind<BR>
ya see <BR>
i was drivin' home<BR>
runnin' red lights<BR>
my time in the realm<BR>
of the charmed<BR>
missing you, wishing youd<BR>
been missin' most of everything<BR>
for better<BR>
than three decades <BR>
now<BR>
