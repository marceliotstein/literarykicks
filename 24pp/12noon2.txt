too rough from my hands, from other than me
no grace. nothing. nothing unfolds as it should
and it should be
i felt something like pain,
sliding out of me,
aching in my chair
meandering, not melancholy
upended books, unopened bills, 
unbidden offers sent to me, 
a watch face down, a glossy photo, 
no space left free
a neglected glass, dusty typewriter at an open door,
an empty duffle tossed upon a hardwood floor,
i feel a growling beat
i am but a stain
groping for 
me
(and the rain
and the door
and a sea in a tree)
from where i sit 
the view does not inspire -
papers stacked on desk, tables and floor
little time for reverie,
or introspection
the job requires one to see
what is there
not to dream what could be
