Build new love.  Over and over.<BR>
Boulders on the sea shore.<BR>
Build with the fecal smell of the final wreckage<BR>

Morph the feared and debased<BR>

Admit the deep power<BR>

your love<BR>

THE TEASING OF FLESH.<BR>
<BR>
Say, this too is a shape of love<BR>
before love.<BR>
Now it is time to choose:<BR>
“NO!<BR>
NO, TO THE HIDEOUS<BR>
LOVELINESS.”<BR>
Soon I will protect<BR>

stand softly<BR>
