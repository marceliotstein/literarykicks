<H3>5 pm</H3>
colonel mustard mustache, caribbean eyes <BR>
fat french toast and 500 rummy<BR>
swimming and meditating<BR>
ingenue woman, sophisticate child<BR>
bouquets alive, somberly grow<BR>
around this fallen human<BR>
to glance upward into the sky<BR>
but no western star met eye<BR>
just darkness<BR>
i fell face first flat<BR>
on slick surface abandon,<BR>
handed the man my ticket<BR>
took seat number 3D<BR>
watched time suspend through windows weeping, <BR>
and when the runway became as little as a line,<BR>
i counted seconds<BR>
pedro, are you gone? <BR>
only to be found in the wind and stars of the night<BR>
who invented separation? who created terminals?<BR>
a certain knopfler riff, piano sound, the shape of a lyric <BR>
it pulls you to mind and i wonder where you are <BR>
this day, a day of poetry, when i would love to hear you sing<BR>
i remember and i never let that memory slip away<BR>
a blog told by a world soul full of funk and fury<BR>
yet flavor none left on your tongue<BR>
faked you out and made you fall<BR>
for the pretty lies i told<BR>
just once i wish i could see<BR>
what it is i missed before<BR>
milk skinny throwing rocks off south docks<BR>
a death for a clown -- of course you drowned<BR>
you forgot and so will i <BR>
sanity <BR>
found solely<BR>
 through needles or jesus<BR>
this i call life<BR>
and live it<BR>
in death, slow, shallow breaths <BR>
noise of want<BR>
as dawn folds<BR>
a father's hope and longing<BR>
you come back through this dust, this air, <BR>
this time, this nothing, this always<BR>
a name<BR>
and the truth of personality<BR>
but what made the name a name <BR>
is going into hiding<BR>
