factual fallacies
the roof above my head
keep the rain 
and keep the dread
inane managers to abhor
photo of girlfriend I adore
writing trash
or maybe
more?
my desk is cluttered and causes me pain
my excuses I use 
truly are poor
what is there
not to dream 
what could be 
what is not there
dared to be 
all 
all
all 
tears
and queers
and quietness
and whores
coming through my door
coming through this mess
in my mind
begging, begging
begging
for
more
staring out upon a parking lot
this asphalt's hot
time, holding me green and dying
i can only hope i find a door
tree green whispers
and pebbles in holy streams
begging
still 
begging for more
