<H3>12 noon</H3>

bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor<BR>
i am white walls<BR>
and<BR>
white floor<BR>
i am my soon, this one, adore<BR>
right now there is no rain,<BR>
the door is to the left of me<BR>
racking my brain, no shame<BR>
crack open the door<BR>
shaking off edges and thoughts<BR>
crack open the door<BR>
the dog seems happy<BR>
the rain <BR>
is falling diagonal <BR>
and i have a funeral tomorrow<BR>
could be a palace of suburbia<BR>
narrow space with junk instead<BR>
dreamings<BR>
dreamings<BR>
dreamings in the core<BR>
bare feet holding toes, curled on carpeted floor<BR>
window slit <BR>
dried rain<BR>
computer refrain<BR>
cant complain<BR>
i see y(our) life bricked in by the windowpane<BR>
nothing left to lose, nothing more to gain<BR>
books<BR>
a party of books<BR>
poetry, anthologies<BR>
a snickety lott of books<BR>
and scalp <BR>
i am home<BR>
and fame <BR>
i am more<BR>
test it<BR>
still<BR>
and still<BR>
and one<BR>
<BR>
<H3>1 pm</H3>
orbital happiness<BR>
stellar gorgeousness, a cosmic chain<BR>
constellations<BR>
and a puddle<BR>
a puddle of rain<BR>
too rough from my hands, from other than me<BR>
no grace. nothing. nothing unfolds as it should<BR>
and it should be<BR>
i felt something like pain,<BR>
sliding out of me,<BR>
aching in my chair<BR>
meandering, not melancholy<BR>
upended books, unopened bills,<BR> 
unbidden offers sent to me, <BR>
a watch face down, a glossy photo, <BR>
no space left free<BR>
a neglected glass, dusty typewriter at an open door<BR>
an empty duffle tossed upon a hardwood floor<BR>
i feel a growling beat<BR>
i am but a stain<BR>
groping for <BR>
me<BR>
(and the rain<BR>
and the door<BR>
and a sea in a tree)<BR>
from where i sit <BR>
the view does not inspire --<BR>
papers stacked on desk, tables and floor<BR>
little time for reverie<BR>
or introspection<BR>
the job requires one to see<BR>
what is there<BR>
not to dream what could be <BR>
<H3>2 pm</H3>
factual fallacies<BR>
the roof above my head<BR>
keep the rain <BR>
and keep the dread<BR>
inane managers to abhor<BR>
photo of girlfriend I adore<BR>
writing trash<BR>
but maybe more<BR>
window slit <BR>
dried rain<BR>
my desk is cluttered and causes me pain<BR>
my excuses I use <BR>
truly are poor<BR>
what is there<BR>
not to dream <BR>
what could be <BR>
what is not there<BR>
dared to be <BR>
all <BR>
all<BR>
all <BR>
tears<BR>
and queers<BR>
and quietness<BR>
and whores<BR>
coming through my door<BR>
coming through this mess<BR>
in my mind<BR>
begging, begging<BR>
begging<BR>
for<BR>
more<BR>
staring out upon a parking lot<BR>
i am but a stain<BR>
this asphalt is hot<BR>
time holds me green and dying<BR>
i can only hope i'll find a door<BR>
tree green whispers<BR>
and pebbles in holy streams<BR>
too rough from my hands<BR>
nothing unfolds as it should<BR>
i'm begging<BR>
still <BR>
i'm begging<BR>
for more<BR>
