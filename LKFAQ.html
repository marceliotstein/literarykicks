            LitKicks FAQ
          </DIV>
          <p /><b>What is LitKicks?</b><br />
            LitKicks is one of the world's longest-running sites dedicated 
            to literature and independent writers and publishers. For more information 
            about how LitKicks got started and how it keeps on chugging, please 
            see our <a href="AboutUs.html">About Us page</a>. 
          <p><strong>What happened to the message boards?</strong><br />
            Here at LitKicks we've always used a variety of ways to interact -- from 
            live events to online discussions; from workshops to member contributed 
            articles. Right now we're focusing on more structured forms of discussion
            as the main way to interact on the site. The old LitKicks message 
            boards are archived on the site in a read-only format. You can find 
            them listed on <a href="Boards.html">this page</a>. 
          <p><b>Will you be bringing the boards back?</b><br />
            At this time we don't have any plans to bring back the previous version 
            of the boards. However, we have several different types of activities 
            and projects planned to keep things interesting and challenging.  These include but are not limited to creative writing challenges, Action Poetry, collaborative writing, literary debates, book reviews and literary news discussions.
          <p><b>Are you still accepting articles?</b><br />
                  The Articles section was closed as part of the November 2004 redesign, not because we are less interested in substantive content about literature, but because we hope the new format will encourage members to write this kind of content on the main part of the site.  One goal of the new design is to better integrate the concept of excellent member-contributed articles with the paradigms of online community.                         
          <p><b>I'd like to announce an event or plug my book. Where can I post 
            my announcment?</b><br />
            We encourage all LitKicks members to include contact information and 
            links to their websites in their <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/memberpage.jsp">member 
            profiles</a>. Your profile is also a good place to list your publications 
            as well. We will soon be offering a method for announcing live readings and other regional events, but this is not yet in place.</a>
          <p><b>How do I get a copy of the LitKicks book?</b><br />
            The first LitKicks anthology, <i>Action Poetry: Literary Tribes for 
            the Internet Age</i> is finished and is available now. The book is 
            available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1418497800/qid=1099261172/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/002-1260533-6206408?v=glance&s=books#product-details">Amazon.com</a>. 
            Please see <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/ActionPoetry">this page</a> 
            for more details. 
          <p><b>I want to participate.  How do I reply to a topic or question?</b><br />
		  To participate, first you'll need to <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/login.jsp">log in</a>.  If you don't have a LitKicks membername, please <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/account.jsp">register</a>.   After you're logged in, click on a discussion topic.  Under the discussion, click the link that says "Write a response".  Compose your response to the topic, add a title and click "Post".  You will be able to edit your message for one hour after you submit it.  If you'd like to add a short comment to someone else's response to the topic, click the response you wish to comment on, then click "Post a comment to this message".
          <p><b>Hey, I posted something and it never showed up! What happened?</b><br />
            It's possible that we haven't reviewed your submission yet. It's more 
            likely that we chose not to publish your writing for any number 
            of reasons. A portion of our submission policy is provided here for 
            your reference: 
          <p>The LitKicks Staff reads all writings submitted to the site and we 
            will try our best to review your work in a timely manner. We reserve 
            the right to edit submissions for content, clarity, length, style, 
            format, spelling and grammar. We do not publish all the submissions 
            we receive, and we reserve the right to reject submitted pieces without 
            explanation. If your writing isn't published it is probably because 
            it demonstrated one (or more) of the following: lack of relevance, 
            lack of coherence, incompleteness, poor grammar/spelling/punctuation, 
            or just plain bad writing. 
          <p><b>How do I log out? Where can I find all the other stuff I've posted?</b><br />
          You can find information about your LitKicks account and postings on your <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/memberpage.jsp">Memberpage</a> or through your profile.
          <p /><b>How do I start a new discussion?</b><br />
            If you have a good idea for a topic or question that 
            you'd like to see the LitKicks community take on, please <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/createThread.jsp">submit 
            it here</a>. After we determine that your question or challenge fits 
            our needs, we'll add it to the site so others can respond. 
          <p /><b>Wait! I don't get it! I'm having a technical problem or need 
            further assistance! Where do I post my feedback?</b> <br />
            If you're having a technical problem, first try refreshing the page, 
            clearing your cache/cookies or try a different browser. We're unable 
            to provide specific tech help in most cases, but if you encounter 
            an error message or if something seems broken, <a href="mailto:litkicks@gmail.com">let 
            us know</a>. </TD>
