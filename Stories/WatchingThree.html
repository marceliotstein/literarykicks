A year or so later, Dennis Williams begins to wonder if he is being 
watched anymore at all.  He picks up a Manhattan phone book one day
at the bank and idly looks up the name of Wallace Janin's agency.  It
is not listed.<P>

He places a call to the custodian of the blind trust which is supposed
to be paying Mr. Janin each month.  He no longer has any connection to
this account, but with much urging and some bribery he is able to persuade
a clerk at the office where the account is maintained to look into recent
activity on the payments.  The clerk informs him that the most recent
check was cashed by a Mr. Wallace Janin several days before.<P>

Dennis wanders, for the first time in decades, back to the lower
midtown  neighborhood where he first visited Mr. Janin.  But most of the
buildings have been replaced by newer ones, and Dennis finds nothing
familiar, and no trace of Mr. Janin.<P>

One day he steps into a liquor store and purchases a bottle of Christian
Brothers brandy.  He leaves it untouched in his house for three days, then
begins drinking it, straight from the bottle, in his bedroom with the shades
drawn.<P>

In a restaurant one night with a woman he'd been dating, Dennis calmly 
orders a bottle of white wine, even though he'd never cared for wine.  
At a night club later that evening he orders a whiskey on the rocks, and
then three more, making no effort to conceal his action.<P>

On the same woman's birthday later that years, he takes her for a weekend
in Atlantic City.  They play craps and baccarat and blackjack, slugging 
down whiskey sours and sloe gin fizzes as they spend their money.  By the 
end of the weekend they are ten thousand dollars poorer, which upsets 
Dennis's lady friend so much that she decides to cease dating him.<P>

At the age of fifty-five, Dennis is told by the Directors of the bank
that there have been inquiries about his plans for retirement.  He is
told that the bank would like to make it easy for him to make this transition
at the earliest possible date.  By this time he is known around the office 
as a useless embarrassment, a good-time Charlie unable to perform any
business functions at all.  His peers are tired of his begging them to
join him for lunches, especially as his lunches invariably involve little
food and many martinis.<P>

At the age of fifty-seven, Dennis Williams spends his last day at the 
bank.  He begins making plans to transfer his Rocky Beach estate to his
children and begin travelling the world.  But not long after his fifty-seventh
birthday he is hospitalized with a severe stroke. <P>

Lying in his bed, his body broken but his mind alert, Dennis Williams
thinks and thinks.  He remembers his father's death thirty years before,
and the meeting with Wallace Janin that followed quickly after.  He 
remembers the glass of champagne he drank in the Pentagon, and the terror
he felt in the parking lot later that day.  He searches all his 
memories, and finally comes to the conclusion that he has never lived
his own life.  Other people could say this about themselves, he thinks,
but somehow he seems to have a unique right to make this claim.  His
life has never been his own, and the only thing he earned, for all
his losses and mistakes, is the bitter aftertaste of regret.  This is 
what Dennis Williams is thinking when he has a second stroke and dies.<P>
