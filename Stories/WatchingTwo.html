<H1><I>Chapter Two</I></H1>
<BR><BR><BR><BR>

One month later, Dennis Williams returns to Wallace Janin's 
office with a folder describing the payment guarantee.  
They review the papers together, shake hands, and all is
done.  Dennis Williams takes the train home that day feeling
exhilarated.  He had made his decision, and he can never take it
back.  Thrilled by this sudden demonstration of his power of will, 
he decides to keep an even greater bargain than he had made, and 
begins a strict regimen of daily exercise and healthy diet.  He eschews 
desserts and even coffee, and begins performing a rigorous calisthenic 
routine each morning.  He is stunned how good it all feels.<P>

Tremendously enthused by his discovery of the joys of clean life, he
is forced to restrain himself from proselytizing to his friends.  His
devotion to discipline occupies his thoughts with an intensity usually
associated with religion.  He experiences a revelation one day, while
enjoying a cool glass of lemonade, that the secret of life is inside a
glass of pure summer lemonade, sweetened with sugar, but not polluted
with rum.  To drink orange juice without vodka!  It bathes his soul, 
immerses him in sweet joyous purity.<P>

At business parties and evenings out, Dennis is commended by friends for
sipping tonic water while others inebriate themselves.  He sometimes
feels a twinge of jealousy over the way everybody else's view of the
world starts to get soft and swirly around the edges while his remains
hard and clear.  But he has no choice about the matter, so he avoids 
tormenting himself wishing for what he can never have.  Occasionally 
he spots a well-dressed stranger in a crowd peering at him , and 
with a chill wonders if he is looking into the eyes of his watcher.  
But there is no way to know, and so he does not waste time in 
wondering.<P>

At work, his career takes on a new intensity, and opportunities
fall before him like dominoes.  By the time he turns thirty he
is a senior partner and an extremely important person.  He and
his wife have a second child and build an addition to their home.
On weekends he swims in his outdoor pool, plays with his children and
reads newspapers on his backyard patio.  He watches the gardeners mow
the green lawn in razor-straight vertical sweeps, feels the
sun caress his skin, and almost shivers with the wholesome joy of 
his life.  <P>

One day he is lying happily on a lawn chair, an iced tea in his hand, 
when he suddenly spots a figure in the top branches of a tree above his 
house.  Or does he spot a figure?  Is it a squirrel?  The wind shaking
the branches?<P>

And is that a twig pointing in his direction, or is the barrel of a 
gun pointing straight at his heart, even as he basks innocently
in the warm summer air?<P>

Because Dennis and his wife entertain friends often, a small bar is
kept in their dining room, well-stocked with expensive bottles.  One
day when his wife is at Atlantic City with her ladies 
club and the children are away at camp, he decides to test Wallace
Janin's men.  He does not plan to drink, but only to determine
whether they are truly monitoring his every activity.  Since he
does not believe any of the men enter his house at night, Dennis
reasons that somebody must be entering the house in the daytime
when it's empty and checking the contents of the
liquor cabinet under the bar.  So he places an invisible strip
of scotch tape across the front, near the bottom where it would
not be seen.  The next day he goes to work, and when he returns 
that night he finds the tape dangling loosely from one side of the
cabinet door.<P>

His first opportunity to cheat comes without warning.  One of his 
clients at the bank is a five-star General, and this General 
asks Mr. Williams and another colleague to travel to 
Washington D.C. for an important
meeting in the Pentagon to discuss a new investment
opportunity.  The meeting goes extremely well, and afterwards 
the General invites the visiting bankers to join him in a 
celebration.  Observing the General's large, secure
and windowless office, Dennis Williams realizes with a
sudden panic that he is about to be offered a drink, and
that there is no imaginable way Mr. Janin's men could know.<P>

The General is unfortunately in a talking mood, and tells 
ludicrous stories as his assistant displays and lavishly 
prepares an expensive bottle of french champagne.  
Dennis Williams grimacingly nods, pretending to listen to
the stories, his soul in torment.  Mr. Janin's men 
simply could have infiltrated the security of this office.  Not 
the Pentagon.  The room has no windows, no hiding places, no 
exposed air ducts.  Dennis's soul twists in agonizing indecision
as the General's assistant hands him a brilliantly cut class.
The moment is shockingly immediate and simple.  He accepts the
glass, and caresses it.  The lead crystal glistens as he rotates the cool
glass in his palm.  He feels so frightened he realizes he cannot 
speak.  He lifts the glass to his lips, and the champagne is
astonishingly bitter and repulsive to his taste.
He turns red as an otherworldly warmth, a deathly calmness, 
seems to spread through his head and neck and trunk and limbs.<P>

It feels as if his body had only been waiting for this moment for
years.  His body welcomes it, and he feels a laughing calmness
deep inside that is completely at odds with the terror possessing
his mind.<P>

And how did the warmth of the alcohol spread so quickly?  He'd once
learned that cyanide acted in this way, that if you put a drop of it
on your tongue you would not even have to swallow it to die.  Enough
is absorbed through the tongue to kill you in an instant.<P>

He finishes most of the drink, leaving only a quarter inch of the
vile yeasty fluid at the bottom of the crystal glass.<P>

The fear of being shot down begins to grip him as he steps out from
the lush, carpeted front lobby of the Pentagon into the bright, 
sunlit, wide-open visitor's parking lot.  He is braced, with every
step, by the thought that a gun might fire before the foot he
lifts touches the ground.  "A quick bullet from a speeding car
in a parking lot," Janin had said.  "This would not be a problem."<P>

With a horrible shock, Dennis realizes that he had not checked the
General's office for a hidden video camera.  Of course there would have
been one!  Janin's men might not be able to infiltrate a building,
but they would be able to bribe a guard.  He pictures himself as
he would appear on the video feed, his face swelling in the center of the
fish-eye lens, furtively sipping his drink.<P>

And, he realizes, his fingerprints are on the glass!  How could
he have been so stupid?  They only have to flirt with a kitchen 
maid to find out all they need to know.<P>

As he walks with his companion to their rented car, his companion
blabs inanely into his ear.  Dennis hears not a word of it, because
a new thought possesses him, a thought more horrifying than the rest.
The detectives do not even need a videotape or a fingerprint to
establish his guilt.  They could simply <I>guess</I> that he had
been offered a drink in the windowless office.  And they could
guess that he had accepted.  They don't need to find proof -- it
is simply obvious that he had taken the drin.k.  But if they are going to 
kill him for that, Dennis realizes, than he could not have saved
himself by not accepting the drink, because then the detectives
would not be able to know that he had refused it.<P>

But, he realizes with desperation, this is not true.  The detectives
know him well by now, and they know what kind of person he is.  They
know he is the kind of person who would take that drink.  If he wasn't
that kind of person, he thinks, then they would know that instead.  But 
he <I>is</I> the kind of person who would take that drink.<P>

He and his associate find their car in the parking lot, and a fat 
man is sitting in a green Thunderbird two cars away, staring at them. 
His door is half open and one foot juts out under the car door to 
dangle over the asphalt.  The man looks at Dennis and Dennis looks
at him.<P>

For the next several days, Dennis lives in fear.  He cannot read, 
and when he sleeps he awakens with a jerk at every sound.  Gradually,
he begins to relax.  Fortunately, he is not able to follow his first
drink with a second.  It was an isolated incident.  He goes back 
to normal.<P>

His second digression takes place eight years later.  By this time his
marriage has ended in divorce.  Even while his marriage was breaking up,
however, Dennis never broke his vow not to be unfaithful to his wife.  Now
that he is divorced, he is freed from that constraint.  But he has not taken
advantage of this freedom yet.  He spends most of his time at the bank, and
his weekends at the golf course.  <P>

He plans his second digression for over a year.  Some strange activities are
necessary, but by planning them well in advance he manages to make it
nearly impossible for any observer to be able to detect a pattern.  One day
he visits a magic store near Times Square and buys a fake moustache and
a toupee and glasses.  Nobody follows him into the store, and only the clerk
sees what he buys.  He puts them away and does nothing else unusual for three
months.  <P>

Then he purchases six airplane tickets, all leaving Kennedy Airport at 
roughly the same time on the same day several months later, one each for 
Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Miami and Seattle.  He will 
use only one of the six.  He puts them away in a locked drawer in his
desk at work.<P>

A month before departure date, he transfers a quarter of a million dollars
in cash from his bank account to a new account in a highly private Swiss
institution.  <P>

The departure date arrives, but Dennis goes to work that day without packing
any luggage.  At lunchtime he informs his secretary that he will be taking
a long lunch, and takes a taxi across the Brooklyn Bridge, gets out, changes
to another taxi in Brooklyn Heights, and goes to Kennedy Airport.<P>

He selects a ticket at random and goes to St. Louis.  In St. Louis he pays
cash for a ticket to Mexico City, and in Mexico City he buys a ticket to
Rome.  From Rome he takes a train to Venice, memorizing every calm
disinterested face in the car.  From Venice he flies to Stockholm, and in 
Stockholm he charters a private flight to Monte Carlo.  In Monte Carlo he
gambles, drinks and has sex with prostitutes for eighteen glorious days, 
sitting at baccarat tables wearing his toupee and moustache and glasses, 
bills in his hand, girls on his lap, glasses on coasters before him.  He
sleeps on dirty beds with women whose name he does not care to know.  He
keeps this up until the eighteenth day when he realizes his pocket money is 
almost gone.<P>

He disposes of his disguise in a garbage can on a dirty sidewalk in a 
slum somewhere on the southern coast of France.  He hires a car to take
him to Paris and flies straight home from there.  Earlier, he'd planned 
to take another random series of flights back to New York, but somehow
by now it does not seem as important.  He does not have the money anyway.  
And there is no way, he reasons, that anybody who sees him arrive at 
Kennedy Airport would know exactly what he'd been up to.  Though it would
not be very hard, he realizes, for somebody to guess.  He does not look very
good.  But then he hasn't looked especially fit for a long time.  Many
years have passed since the days when he performed a calisthenic routine
every morning, the days when a glass of lemonade was an ecstatic experience.<P>

He exits the airplane wondering if he is about to get shot.  His knees 
almost buckle with panic as he steps past the arrival gate and hears 
a burst of loud noise and sees bodies rush towards him.  But it is just 
a family greeting a man walking behind him.<P>
