<H1>Snow</H1>

<I>by Levi Asher</I><P>

"I'm breathing through a slice"<BR>
<I>-- Phish</I><P>

The day it first snowed it was incredibly cold.  The<BR>
flakes were hard and brittle and they<BR>
crashed in the air and shattered into<BR>
small white specks of dust.  The snow wasn't soft,<BR>
just white cardboard flecks that fell all day and evening.<BR> 
That night Maggie and I looked out the window<BR>
and saw that the sky glowed neon orange<BR>
pulsing inside blue black<BR>
like the surface of Mars.<P>

The next day snow decorated Manhattan,<BR>
vanilla icing on the cake.<BR> 
Taxis timidly rolled over cakey mounds of snow.<BR>
It kept snowing, and at work we went out during lunch<BR>
and threw snowballs, then went straight home because of the snow.<BR>
I got to play with my kids, because it was<BR>
a snow day for them too, and we were all in good moods.<P>

The next few nights the snow stopped, then started again.<BR>
There was a heavier snow that blanketed the old snow,<BR>
except this day was warmer, and the flakes were soft and thick<BR>
they gathered in airy crystalline wet clumps on the fingers<BR>
of our gloves.  The new snow formed a pure thin layer<BR>
of whiteness, perfect pure white, over the ice-frozen hard old snow<BR>
which peeked out in patches from beneath the new snow.<BR>
The old snow looked ugly, gray and dirty under the<BR>
new snow, and more snowflakes landed gently on<BR>
top of the snow that had already fallen, covering with<BR>
purer white each layer of white beneath it.<BR>
People walked on the snow and kicked it around, and<BR>
cars and taxis barreled down the avenues<BR>
and by the end of the day the old snow and the new snow had<BR>
clotted together into one substance, a chippy cakey texture<BR>
that radiated a muted light velvet gray.<P>

It snowed and snowed ... and they called it a blizzard on the news.<BR>
Maggie and me and my sister Suzanne and her husband Jake<BR> 
had planned to go to a 10:00 movie at Lincoln Center<BR>
Cinemas on 66th Street that night, and we almost cancelled but<BR>
then we decided to go.  We were in strange moods.<BR>
We exited the theatre at twelve-thirty in the morning and<BR>
saw that the weather had changed while we were watching the movie.<BR>
It was now ten degrees warmer, and 66th Street and Broadway<BR> 
had instaneously thawed into a glorious mess of<BR>
mashed crunchy liquid snow.  People stepped into the slush<BR>
and kicked it around, laughing, because it was up<BR>
to their ankles, like a weird cold monster soup taking over the<BR>
midnight city.  People walked in the middle of the street, because<BR>
there were no taxis or cars, and when a taxi finally came, people<BR>
who would never share a taxi -- diamond necklaced types from Lincoln<BR>
Center and butchers from late-night Broadway meat shops -- would share<BR>
them, because Manhattan had turned into a gigantic gray slurpee,<BR>
and we were all in this mess together.<P>

The next day it got cold again, and the slush froze, and now<BR>
mounds of jagged ice lined the streets, packets of sharp<BR>
cold snow trapped within the fizzling dirty<BR>
ice like bones inside a fossil.<BR>
These sharp-edged ice formations pleased nobody and they were<BR>
not beautiful.  They did not go away, either.  Two weeks<BR>
later they still covered the curbs, now half-melted and<BR>
thin but still scary, speckled with thick black particles of <BR>
dirt and road tar and fragments of lost scarves and gloves, <BR>
now waterlogged and wrung into twisted shapes, mysterious<BR>
fabrics merging with the ugly snow itself.  Weird to look at.<BR>
It wasn't even cold anymore and nobody could figure out<BR>
why the snow wouldn't just melt and go away.<P>

A  month later the mounds of snow<BR>
were still there, now just a few inches high around<BR>
the curbs, simmering in the sun.   It was middle-spring and<BR> 
people were walking around in shorts.<BR>
But the mounds lingered, soft and weak, sometimes forming<BR>
tidepools of melting dirty water<BR>
with little trapped insects floating on top.<P>

Any little kid or tired old man could've kicked an<BR>
entire mound into oblivion without even trying<BR>
very hard.  We stopped seeing the mounds.  Then in early April<BR>
one day I was walking and I<BR>
suddenly noticed at my feet a thin strip of a strange<BR>
unsightly sponge-like substance.  It was maybe an inch wide,<BR>
less than a foot long, and it looked like a thrown away<BR>
piece of rain-soaked shoe leather.  But it was fizzling. <BR>
I stared at it and realized it was the last remainder of the<BR>
mound of snow that fell during our famous winter storm.<BR>
The mound had lived way too long now, and it was time<BR>
for the mound to go.  It was a warm day in April and<BR>
spring was coming, coming soon.<P>
