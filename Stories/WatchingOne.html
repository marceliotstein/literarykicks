Wallace Janin of the Wallace Janin Detective Agency rises to 
greet a well-dressed young man who enters his office.  
"May I help you?"<P>

"Yes," says the visitor.  "My name is Dennis Williams.  I think 
I may be in need of your services."<P>

"Please have a seat," says Wallace Janin, motioning towards a black
leather chair in the center of the room.  "What can I do for you?"<P>

The young man nervously begins.  "I would like to arrange to be 
watched," he says.  "I asked around, you see, and I was told 
that you might be able to provide this service in a very
discreet manner.  That is exactly what I need."<P>

"Why would you like to be watched?"<P>

"I am 27 years old," says the visitor.  "I am a junior partner at 
Greyson Dean Finlay, down on Wall Street.  I recently married and my 
wife is about to give birth to our first child.  I've also recently
recieved a very large inheritance.  At this juncture in my 
life, I have decided that it is imperative for me to follow the 
straightest path.  In short, I have some habits I need to be 
cured of."<P>

"I see," says the older man behind the desk.<P>

"I like to drink," says Dennis Williams.  "I like it too much.  
I'd like to be watched so that I am prevented from drinking again.
In fact I'd like to be prevented from even having to think about
drinking again.  So if I ever take a drink, I would like to be 
shot to death immediately afterwards."<P>

"Ahh," says Mr. Janin.  "And how long would you like this surveillance
to continue?"<P>

"For the rest of my life," says the young man.<P>

Wallace Janin leans back in his plush leather chair and considers this.
He places his hands together and closes his eyes a moment before he 
speaks.  "So you've fallen into quite a little puddle of money, have
you?" he says.<P>

"I am free to spend my inheritance any way I wish," says Mr. Williams.
"This is the best thing I can do with the money."<P>

"Lifelong full surveillance is a tall order.  Have you thought
about how much it would cost?"<P>

"Mr. Janin, I've given this a great deal of thought.  I am prepared 
to pay one hundred thousand dollars a year for your service.  I would 
create a blind trust which would write you a check each month.  Once you and I 
sign the agreement, I would have no ability to stop this fund from 
paying you.  I would have no connection to the fund whatsoever, in fact, and 
you and I would never need to meet again."<P>

"And if it became necessary for us to kill you?  How long do
the payments continue after your death?"<P>

"Upon my death, no matter what the cause of death, the entire 
remainder of the account is immediately transferred to you," 
Mr. Williams says.  "I do not want you to be motivated
to keep me alive, if it comes to that."<P>

Mr. Janin nods.  "You've thought this out well," he says.<P>

Dennis Williams continues.  "Since I'm already going to the trouble of
being watched, I'd like to also arrange to be shot if I ever gamble.  Not
that I think this will happen -- men who gamble also drink, and if I drink
I would not expect to live long enough to gamble.  Finally, 
I'd like to be shot if I am ever unfaithful to my wife."<P>

Mr. Janin nods.  "Might as well do the whole shebang at once," he says.<P>

"Will you take the job?" Dennis Williams asks.<P>

Wallace Janin looks down for a moment, considering.  He looks up and
flips open a brass cigarette case.  "Smoke?" he says.<P>

"Thank you," says the visitor. <P> 

Mr. Janin hands him a cigarette and offers
him a light.  The men puff tensely.  Finally Mr. Janin speaks.  
"I've never been offered a case just like this.  Unfortunately, 
Mr. Williams, I don't think I will be able to accept it."<P>

Dennis Williams flushes with surprise and anger.  "Why not?"<P>

"Without a doubt your actions come from the highest 
motives," Wallace Janin says.  "However they are certainly
impulsive.  I am quite sure you would come to regret this
arrangement if you made it.  I do not like to involve 
myself in any business which will not have a satisfactory
conclusion."<P>

"Mr. Janin," Dennis Williams says.  "I assure you that I am 
not acting on impulse.  I have been thinking about it
for a long time.  I believe this is the only thing that
will save my life.  Please don't deny me the benefit of
your services.  I've heard that you are more trustworthy
than anybody else in this business.  If you won't take it
on, I don't know where else to turn."<P>

Mr. Janin shrugs.  "It's true, there's nobody in New York 
who would do this better than I would.  I just don't know what I 
think of the entire business."<P>

"Are you concerned about being implicated in my murder, should it
become necessary?" Dennis asks.<P>

Mr. Janin raises an eyebrow and smiles.  "Ahh, no.  A bullet 
through a window at night, a quick shot from a speeding car 
in a parking lot ... my men would not find this difficult.  
That would be the easy part."<P>

"I see," Dennis says, feeling a slight chill at the cool efficiency
of Mr. Janin's answer.<P>

Mr. Janin closed his eyes for a moment to think.  "Let me tell you 
what I'll do," he says.  "I want to make sure you know what
you're doing before we discuss this any further.  You're a very young
man and this decision will affect you for a long time.  You see,
it is your youth that makes this request so dramatic.  If you
were sixty-five years old with a pot belly and a liver problem,
I'd accept this offer without a qualm."<P>

"I understand," Dennis says.<P>

"Here's what we'll do.  You think about this for a month.  During that 
month, I will ask my men to begin surveying your activities.  You 
may see them around -- please understand, when you do, that this
is only an exercise, and not a permanent arrangement.  At the end
of one month, you come back here.  In the meanwhile, pay me for the
first month and start putting the paperwork for the blind trust 
together.  If you still want to do this in month, I will not 
turn you down."<P>

"Your men will begin following me," Dennis says.  "But will they shoot me, if 
I drink?"<P>

"Would you like them to?" Wallace Janin says.<P>

"Yes."<P>

"I will instruct them to do so."<P>

"And I will have one month's payment transferred to you immediately,
on this basis." Dennis Williams says.<P>

"This sounds fine to me," Wallace Janin says.  <P>

"I guess you'll need to know where I can be found," Dennis says.  "I
live on 17 Mockingbird Lane in Rocky Beach, Long Island.  My wife
recently installed a large glass window by the beach entrance, and
that might be a good place for you to position observers at night.  
I often visit the Princeton Club with friends during the week, and 
on weekends --"<P>

He stops when he sees that Mr. Janin is not writing anything 
down.  "Mr. Williams," Wallace Janin says.  "I have told you that
I will begin the surveillance immediately.  By the end of today,
my men will know more about you than you know about yourself.  There
is certainly no need for you to give me a headstart."<P>

"Ah," Dennis said.  "Of course.  I understand."<P>

"I will see you in one month," Wallace Janin says.<P>

"And after that," Dennis says, "never again."<P>
