<H1>Ethel Mae In Albuquerque</H1>
<I>by Levi Asher</I><P>

In all the history of "I Love Lucy," there was exactly one episode
dedicated to Ethel Mertz.<P>

Ethel has always been an enigma, and so was the actress who played her, Vivian
Vance.  Did it bother Vivian Vance that she got the role partly because 
she was a woman Lucille Ball could look glamorous standing next to?  Did 
she resent this fact?  And just who <I>was</I> Ethel Mertz?  Only 
one episode tries to answer this question, and it turns out to be
one of the more surreal "I Love Lucy" episodes ever.<P>

It takes place during the road trip to California -- that odd moment 
in time when Lucy and Ricky and Fred and Ethel suddenly clamor into
a large automobile and begin roaming down Route 66 like the Joad family, 
searching for America.  They pass through Albuquerque, New Mexico, and 
it turns out Albuquerque is Ethel Mertz's hometown.<P>

A lot of people in Albuquerque are thrilled to 
have "Ethel Mae Potter" coming back for a visit, and by the time
they arrive the entire town is in an excited frenzy, because apparently
"Ethel Mae Potter" was the most popular girl in town, 
the homecoming queen and all that, and so the newspapers are 
there to take pictures, and the phones are ringing off the hook, and 
soon somebody has rented an entire theatre for an evening, because 
there are just so many people who want to see the return of their 
beloved Ethel Mae Potter.<P>

Ethel, of course, loves every minute of it.  But where the show starts 
getting Dostoevskian is this -- backstage at the theatre, Lucy and \
Ricky and Fred are <I>burning up</I>.  This is <I>their</I>
Ethel: Ethel Mertz, the landlord's wife, the one who wears the dumpy 
dresses.  What the hell right does she have to bask in all this love and glory?<P>

And, would you believe it, the three of them actually sabotage her show.  She
steps onstage to great applause and begins trilling the opening notes to 
"Shortnin' Bread" (apparently quite the hot wax back in the exciting 50's), 
and Fred and Lucy and Ricky start clowning around behind her, doing 
acrobatics and holding up funny signs that say things like
"Man-eating Tiger" (followed by Ricky strolling across stage eating a 
marshmallow tiger).  <P>

Yeah, yeah, it's funny.  I even laughed.  But jeez, guys, 
couldn't you have given Ethel a break?  Just this once, the one chance she'll
ever have?<P>

Come on, Ethel ... don't mind them, just face the ones who love you,
and keep on belting out "Shortnin' Bread.  As for me, point me in the 
direction of Albuquerque.<P>
