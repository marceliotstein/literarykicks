<H1>The House</H1>

Back when I was a kid, I used to sit in my bedroom and write stories.
Then I grew up and went to college and afterwards found myself 
back in my bedroom, "living at home", as this is strangely called.  
We were out on Long Island, about an hour from Manhattan, and to keep 
myself sane I signed up for an expensive writing workshop at Barnard University, uptown near Columbia.<P>

I was working as a software engineer for a robotics company, a really
dull existence since I've never been interested in robotics.  I had to
wear "business dress", which I bought at Robert Hall's on
Jericho Turnpike in Dix Hills.  Cotton shirts, those uncomfortable
pants called "slacks" which are really no 
fun to play frisbee in, black socks
from Sears and black lace shoes that 
I always forgot to polish.<P>

My writing workshop was my only connection to a more artistic self I'd 
somehow lost touch with, and so every Wednesday I'd sneak out of work early, 
throw off my dilbert uniform and toss on jeans and a t-shirt, and 
drive my Dad's Buick into the big city, the best night of my week.<P>

The teacher was a semi-famous literary novelist from the Upper East 
Side, whose name I guess I shouldn't mention.  She had 
frizzy mouse-colored hair and big glasses and a small wiry 
build, but she wasn't Joyce Carol Oates, though I guess she was close. 
There were twelve students in the class, and 
I felt out of place from the first day, maybe because I was the
youngest one there and apparently the only one who'd driven 
an hour on the Long Island Expressway to get to Manhattan.  The dress code
was a little more stylish than I'd anticipated, and my black Jethro
Tull concert t-shirt didn't go over as well as I'd hoped. <P>

Anyway, the teacher explained that each week three students would
read the pieces they were working on, and the class would critique.
I was put in the third, so I did two sessions of critiquing other people's
works before I got to read my own, and I got annoyed because every time
somebody read something people would just make tidy little comments about
particular sentences or word choices, and nobody would say whether they
liked the piece or not.  Sometimes the entire discussion would avoid
the question of whether the piece worked or not.  A woman read a piece 
about being the mother of a retarded child, and somebody objected to
her use of the word "lemon yellow" to describe a banana, because it 
would be more correct to describe it as "banana yellow", and then
the entire class erupted into an argument about this and we ran out
of time and the woman never found out what anybody thought of her
piece.  I occasionally tried to raise my hand and say something more 
direct about whether I liked a piece, but I didn't exactly feel
comfortable speaking up, and every time I did people squinted nastily
at me like their class was being invaded by Long Island kids wearing
Jethro Tull concert t-shirts.<P>

Finally it came my turn to read.  I was workshopping a 
novel I'd been working on for years, a fictional piece about
a lonely depressed kid who lives with his parents on Long Island.  I began
reading the latest draft of my first chapter, and as I read it
a strange thing started to happen.  Looking down at the paper as I 
stutteringly recited, I somehow sensed from an ambient feeling in the 
room that the class was getting what I was saying, 
and I looked up from my paper and I could see from 
their faces that they actually were.  They were looking sad at the sad parts,
nodding their heads in recognition at the poignant parts, and not 
even getting all bent out of shape when I said "fuck" or quoted
the Ramones.  I reached the end of the piece and the class 
erupted in applause (which almost never happened in this workshop, there
was usually no applause at all) and then afterwards people gathered
around me saying "How do you write so well?" and "I love the part 
where ...!"  I was in a pretty happy mood that night.<P>

A few weeks later the teacher told me she'd like her agent to read my
novel.  Her agent was a high-powered top literary name -- she also represented,
weirdly enough, Michael Jackson and Jackie O.  The agent read my novel, and 
guess what?  She hated it.  End of that story.<P>

Except that now I'd gotten my hopes all high.  I requested a meeting with
the agent to find out what exactly she didn't like (even though I knew
this was a faux pas, when you get rejected you're just supposed to kind
of slink away and stay rejected).  She welcomed me into her office and
told me my use of present tense was distracting and my main character was 
a cipher, but she did love the part where the couple finally has sex.  I 
asked her if she would read it again if I changed the present tense to 
past tense.  She told me we'd do lunch sometime.<P>

So I had no prospects for an agent now, but I did change the present 
tense to past, and I also decided I used a childish phrasing sometimes,
and so I went through the text trying to make each sentence more spare
and elegant.  I cut the novel from 365 pages to 273, and I gave it 
a new title which I didn't even like as much as the old title, but
it sounded less off-putting and more sophisticated.  Then I 
signed up for a different writing workshop at the New School, this one 
taught by a male novelist in a wheelchair who lived on the Upper West Side. 
I presented the new version of my first chapter to the class, and they
liked it and said nice things, but somehow I sensed that they didn't even
like it as much as the earlier class had liked it, which meant my
improvements had made it worse instead of better.  I was furious when 
I got home.  The next day I decided to try an experiment.  I got shit-faced on a 
bottle of Pina Colada mix, locked myself in my bedroom, and started 
rewriting the entire novel from scratch, purely from memory, and
the rule was that I couldn't use any of the same words.  It was wild.  
I ended up doing this for four days straight -- going to
work during the day, then going home and locking myself back in my room, and
I produced a completely new version of the same novel and read a section from
the middle to my class the next time my turn came.  But even as I began reading
it, I had a scary feeling that my experiment hadn't worked, that instead of
producing a miraculous spontaneous work I'd only managed to destroy the natural
fiber that had held my work together in the first place, and I was right, because
the class didn't get what I was trying to do at all.  They didn't think the funny
parts were funny or understand that the sad parts were sad.  
It was a horrible disaster for me.  Back at work, I considered giving up 
my dreams of being a writer and facing a life designing robotic 
factory-floor automation systems.  <P>

But I gathered together my courage, and I decided to take both 
versions of the novel and combine them into one super-powered 
version, and I changed the damn thing back to present tense, 
because I still liked present tense better.  I wanted to preserve 
whatever was in the first version that that class had liked so much,
even though when I looked back at those words now they seemed
precious and arch.  But I persevered, and I spent two and a half years 
working on the final version of the novel.  I tried to be
incredibly economical and self-critical, removing or fixing 
every single word and thought and characterization that I didn't
think was completely true and pure and perfect, and after two and
a half years I had reduced it the size of a novella, 91 pages, and 
then I signed up for another writing workshop, this
one at NYU taught by a young guy who always wore bright red and
blue striped sweaters and had furry black hair and a moustache
and looked like he should have gotten a job as a TV film critic. <P>

I read the first chapter -- which in this new shorter version was
the equivalent of four chapters in the first version -- and the class 
pretended to like it, because I think they somehow sensed
that it was important to me that they liked it, and so
they said it was "spare" and "economical" and "intelligent".
I knew it was a flop, an even worse flop than the one before.  
Anyway, it was too short to publish as
a novel now anyway, and I decided after all this work I was at least
going to squeeze a goddamn short story out of the fucking thing, so I 
cut even more out of it until it was short enough to submit to literary
journals, and then I sent it out, and it got rejected everywhere I 
sent it.<P>

I didn't come out of this semi-insane state of mind until I reached my
early 30's, when I started getting involved with various proto-literary communities on the internet and found this environment infinitely more natural, more organic and real and satisfying.  The final time I took a workshop was in 1993, and I remember by this time only getting angry at all 
the inane, ridiculous comments the
students made when they critiqued.  Once an 80-year-old man came 
shuffling slowly in his walker to hand his story 
up to the teacher, because the old man's lungs were 
too weak for him to read it himself, and the story 
was brilliant.  It was a comic piece about his life as a
homosexual hustler in the 1940's around Times Square, and how he used
to sleep under the Williamsburg Bridge and shoot junk and steal things
from stores.  I was the only one who liked it.  The rest of the
class smothered it with stale marshmallows.  Like "I thought the sentence about
the sun rising over the smelly Hudson was kind of evocative."  
Or "It's a good first draft, but now you have to figure out what you're
trying to say."  Or the old lady with the knitting needles 
who had to pipe up with "Are you sure it's a good idea to 
say 'sucking his cock' if you want to get it published?"
and everybody could just tell that she was only asking the question because
it was her lifelong ambition to say 'sucking his cock' 
in front of a large group of strangers.<P>

At least nobody said "Show, don't tell."<P>

Looking back on my desparate years, I realize now that I was suffering from the literary 
equivalent of anorexia.  I was trying to make my writing smaller 
and smaller, perfecter and perfecter, in the hope that it would 
finally be so small that nothing bad could possibly be left in it.  
My writing had become stublike and twisted 
and impossible to love, and I didn't even love it 
myself by the end.  I wonder if these writing workshops had been helpful to
me at all.  Just what a young writer needs, a roomful of super-egos.  Thanks but no thanks.<P>

Maybe a workshop would be good if there was a rule: say good things or nothing at all.
Writers don't need people spelling out the reasons they hate us -- it's good to know why you like us, but it doesn't help much to hear all about why you don't.  
Like Groucho Marx says, "Give me a rose or leave me alone."<P>

But I'm glad to say I've recovered and I'm happier now.  And just for the hell of it, here's the very final final version of the novel, the minimalist version I created a couple of workshops after the last one, after I had turned it from a novel into a novella into a short story, a very short story in fact, and not even so short that it isn't bad.  But I do think I managed to cut out every word that isn't true, so here's what's left.
