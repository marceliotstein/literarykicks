<i>Ham on Rye,</i> published in 1982, is a narrative of <A HREF="bukmain.html">Bukowski's</a>  childhood and young adulthood, through his autobiographical character <A HREF="chinaski.html"> Henry Chinaski.</A> It begins with his earliest memory, that of several pairs of legs viewed from beneath a table.<p>

Simultaneously comic and poignant, <i>Ham on Rye</i> is a novel that studies three influences that had a huge impact on the artist's life and work:<br><p>

1.) His father's cruelty<br>
2.) His severe, disfiguring acne<br>
3.) His early experiences with alcohol<br><p>

Throughout his art a sense of being an outcast is felt, a sense of alienation, and a distinct rugged individualism. In <i>Ham on Rye</i> Bukowski analyzes his early life and tells the story of how Bukowski became Bukowski.<p>

<A HREF="ham20.html">Chapter Twenty</A> of <i>Ham on Rye</i> describes young  Henry Chinaski  as he encounters cruelty among his friends, among the adults in the neighborhood, and at home as well.<p>

Later, in <A HREF="ham51.html">Chapter Fifty One</A> of <i>Ham on Rye</i> we find Henry as a failing young college student and fledgling alcoholic writer.<p>
