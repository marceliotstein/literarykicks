<B>YOUNG IN NEW ORLEANS</B><p>

<pre>

starving there, sitting around the bars,<br>
and at night walking the streets for<br>
hours,<br>
the moonlight always seemed fake<br>
to me, maybe it was,<br>
and in the French Quarter I watched<br>
the horses and buggies going by,<br>
everybody sitting high in the open<br>
carriages, the black driver, and in<br>
back the man and the woman,<br>
usually young and always white.<br>
and I was always white.<br>
and hardly charmed by the <br>
world.<br>
New Orleans was a place to<br>
hide.<br>
I could piss away my life,<br>
unmolested.<br>
except for the rats.<br>
the rats in my dark small room<br>
very much resented sharing it<br>
with me.<br>
they were large and fearless<br>
and stared at me with eyes<br>
that spoke <br>
an unblinking<br>
death.<br>
<p>

women were beyond me.<br>
they saw something<br>
depraved.<br>
there was one waitress<br>
a little older than<br>
I, she rather smiled,<br>
lingered when she<br>
brought my<br>
coffee.<br>
<p>

that was plenty for <br>
me, that was<br>
enough.<br>
<p>

there was something about<br>
that city, though<br>
it didn't let me feel guilty<br>
that I had no feeling for the<br>
things so many others<br>
needed.<br>
it let me alone.<br>
<p>

sitting up in my bed<br>
the llights out,<br>
hearing the outside<br>
sounds,<br>
lifting my cheap<br>
bottle of wine,<br>
letting the warmth of<br>
the grape<br>
enter<br>
me<br>
as I heard the rats <br>
moving about the<br>
room,<br>
I preferred them<br>
to<br>
humans.<br>
<p>

being lost,<br>
being crazy maybe<br>
is not so bad<br>
if you can be<br>
that way<br>
undisturbed.<br>
<p>

New Orleans gave me<br>
that.<br>
nobody ever called<br>
my name.<br>
<p>

no telephone,<br>
no car,<br>
no job,<br>
no<br>
anything.<br>
<p>

me and the <br>
rats<br>
and my youth,<br>
one time,<br>
that time<br>
I knew<br>
even through the<br>
nothingness,<br>
it was a <br>
celebration<br>
of something not to<br>
do<br>
but only<br>
know.<br>
