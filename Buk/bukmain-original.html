 Charles Bukowski was born in Germany in 1920 and came with his family
 to the United States when he was three years old. He grew up in
 poverty in Los Angeles, drifted extensively, and for much of his life
 made his home in <A
 HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Buk/pedro.html">San Pedro</a>.
 Bukowski had been a writer since childhood, published his first story
 at age twenty four, and began publishing poetry when he was
 thirty-five.<p>

 Bukowski is generally considered to be an honorary 
 <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicks.html">"beat
 writer,"</a> although he was never actually associated with <A
 HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>, <A
 HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>, and the other
 bona fide beat writers. His style, which exhibits a strong sense of
 immediacy and a refusal to embrace standard formal structure, has
 earned him a place in the hearts of beat generation readers, and the
 contributers to the <a
 href="news:alt.books.beatgeneration">alt.books.beatgeneration</a>
 newsgroup. He was a prolific (it isn't known how much he had written;
 much of it was sent off to publishers long-hand and never seen
 again), free-formed, humorous, and painfully honest writer. His
 topics included hang-overs, the <A
 HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Buk/factotum.html#stains">shit
 stains on his underwear,</A> <A
 HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Buk/bmusic.html">classical
 music</A>, horse-racing and whores. He was at home with the people of
 the streets, the skid row bums, the hustlers, the transient life
 style. His language is the poetry of the streets viewed from the
 honesty of a hang-over.<p>

 Most of Bukowski's work is based on his own experience. In 
 <A HREF="www.litkicks.com/Buk/ham.html">Ham On Rye</i></A> 
 we follow his autobiographical character, <A
 HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Buk/chinaski.html"> Henry
 Chinaski </A> through his childhood and early years.<p>

 In <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Buk/factotum.html"> 
 <i>Factotum</i></A> we again find  Henry Chinaski, now in his most
 vinuous days, wandering from city to city, from job to job, from
 woman to woman. Bukowski became widely known after the release of the
 movie <A
 HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/M/title-exact?+=barfly"><i>Barfly</i></A
  based on his life around the time  <i>Factotum</i> takes place.
 Bukowski wrote the screenplay and was somewhat involved in the
 production of this film which featured Mickey Rourke in the role of
 Chinaski/Bukowski.  <i>Barfly</i> was produced by <A
 HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Topics/CattleCall.html">Francis
 Ford Coppola</A> whose current project is alledgedly a film
 adaptation of <A
 HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Books/OnTheRoad.html"> On the
 Road.</A><p>

 Prior to the release of <i>Barfly,</i> Bukowski was best known by the
 public at large, for his novel <A
 HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Buk/post.html"><i>Post
 Office.</i></a> Although <i>Barfly</i> brought Hank to the masses in
 a big way, Bukowski is primarily known in literary circles for his
 poetry. He has stated that he does not consider himself  a poet, but
 simply a writer. "To say I'm a poet puts me in the company of
 versifiers, neontasters, fools, clods, and skoundrels masquerading as
 wise men." He has also made clear that he does not like "form" in
 poetry, referring to it as "a paycheck for learning to turn the same
 screw that has held things together." (This from sure, no. 3) If you
 are not familiar with Bukowski's poetry, well, please judge for
 yourself : <br><P>
