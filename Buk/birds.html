<B>THE BLACKBIRDS ARE ROUGH TODAY</B><p>

<pre>

</pre>

lonely as a dry and used orchard<br>
spread over the earth<br>
for use and surrender.<br><p>

shot down like an ex-pug selling<br>
dailies on the corner.<br><p>

taken by tears like <br>
an aging chorus girl<br>
who has gotten her last check.<br><p>

a hanky is in order your lord your<br>
worship.<br><p>

the blackbirds are rough today<br>
like<br>
ingrown toenails<br>
in an overnight<br>
jail---<br>
wine wine whine,<br>
the blackbirds run around and<br>
fly around<br>
harping about<br>
Spanish melodies and bones.<br><p>

and everywhere is<br>
nowhere---<br>
the dream is as bad as<br>
flapjacks and flat tires:<br><p>

why do we go on<br>
with our minds and<br>
pockets full of<br>
dust<br>
like a bad boy just out of<br>
school---<br>
you tell<br>
me,<br>
you who were a hero in some<br>
revolution<br>
you who teach children<br>
you who drink with calmness<br>
you who own large homes<br>
and walk in gardens<br>
you who have killed a man and own a<br>
beautiful wife<br>
you tell me<br>
why I am on fire like old dry<br>
garbage.<br><p>

we might surely have some interesting<br>
correspondence.<br>
it will keep the mailman busy.<br>
and the butterflies and ants and bridges and<br>
cemeteries<br>
the rocket-makers and dogs and garage mechanics<br>
will still go on a<br>
while<br>
until we run out of stamps<br>
and/or<br>
ideas.<br><p>

don't be ashamed of<br>
anything; I guess God meant it all<br>
like<br>
locks on <br>
doors.<br>
