Actually I'm feeling pretty good lately.  Things
are going great, what with the book coming out,
scoring a major project assignment at work, the
kids being healthy and happy, etc.  On the other
side, my stepfather's bone cancer is getting worse,
and him being a sort of "lust for life" kind of guy 
who never let anything slow him down before, he
now seems determined to go through every one
of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's stages of acceptance
(denial, anger, etc.) as slowly and dramatically 
and painfully as possible.   This ordeal, 
contrasted with my own personally happy state
of mind right now, is one reason I'm so flaky
and absent-minded lately.  <P>

Favorite music of the moment: anything by Phish,
especially "Divided Sky", "Cavern", "Sparkle".
Keeping it light.<P>
