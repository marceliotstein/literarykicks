Whenever I find myself stuck in the same blah mood too
long, I end up digging up my Buddhist books and trying 
to find some cosmic significance.  Do you realize how
many times a day a person cycles through happiness, sadness,
fear, hope, anger, gratitude, etc?  Would we all be better off if
we could turn down the volumes on our emotions?  From "10"
down to maybe "3" or "4"?  I think this is the Buddhist answer:
tune it down, keep it low, stop being a puppet to your
basically dysfunctional emotional responses.  I think this
is my answer too.  Unfortunately, it's difficult bordering on
impossible to make this happen, but I think it's worth trying.
