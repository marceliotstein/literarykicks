LitKicks was founded in July 1994 by <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/Profile.jsp?who=brooklyn">Levi Asher</A>, then a struggling writer bored by his tech job at the headquarters of the JP Morgan bank.  Operated surreptitiously from Asher's cubicle on Wall Street, LitKicks quickly became a popular online destination and "critic's favorite," also gaining wide usage on college campuses around the world.<P> 

In 1996, LitKicks began hosting poetry readings in New York City.  In 1998 a separate division, LitKicks Publishing, was formed.  The first LitKicks publication was a digital video, "Notes From Underground", which was widely praised in Wired Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, Village Voice, New York Press and Time Digital.  (Okay, if you really want to see our clippings, <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Clippings/">here are a few</A> ...)<P>

LitKicks has grown to include several volunteer staffers and plans to increase its offline presence with more live events, video projects and book publications in 2003.

<H3>Looking Back ...</H3>

LitKicks has gone through as many different looks as a 70's glam rock band since its inception in 1994.  Here's a trip back in time ...<P>

<UL>
  <LI>Spring 2001 to Summer 2002: Our '<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicks.html">Midsummer Night's Dream</A> phase.  We still think this was a great front page, but it was probably our most unpopular one ever. </LI>
  <LI>Autumn 1995 to Spring 2001</LI><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksSept95.html">This page</A> ran for a long time.  We'd like to thank photograper Fred McDarrah for being nice enough not to sue us for that photo of Kerouac in his Jesus pose.</LI>
  <LI>April 1997:  <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/GinsbergTribute.html">This replaced the front page for a few weeks after Allen Ginsberg died.</A></LI>
  <LI>July 1994: '<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksJuly94.html">Remember back in the days</A>' ...?  This is how it all started.<P>

<H3>Tech Notes</H3>

LitKicks runs on a Linux server with a MySQL database.  The content management system was custom-built in Java/JSP.  Message boards use the <A HREF="http://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive</A> software package, and the search engine is an implementation of <A HREF="http://www.jakarta.org/Lucene">Lucene</A> (part of the <A HREF="http://www.jakarta.org">Jakarta</A> open source project.  Graphic design takes place on the tangerine iMac in Levi Asher's apartment in Queens.<P>
