<H1>Philip Lamantia</H1>

Born: October 23, 1927 <BR>
Place of Birth: San Francisco <P>

Philip Lamantia discovered Surrealism as a teenager in 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>.
Immediately drawn to this movement, he began to write Surrealist
poetry and left California for New York to meet Andre Breton, who
immediately recognized the young man's talent and began 
publishing his poems.  Lamantia's work appeared in Breton's 
<I>VVV</I>, as well as Charles Henri Ford's <I>View</I> and other
experimental journals.<P>

While in New York, Lamantia became friends with 
<A HREF="../People/CarlSolomon.html">Carl Solomon</A> and
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>.
and several other members of the crowd that would later become the 
Beat movement. 
Lamantia was the first to read at the 
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A> 
poetry reading in 1955.  Instead of reading his own works that 
night, he read several poems by a friend, John Hoffman, who'd 
recently died in 
<A HREF="../Places/Mexico.html">Mexico</A>, 
apparently of a peyote overdose. <P>

Now classified, however incorrectly, as a Beat poet, Lamantia
published several popular books of poetry, and has remained 
active in avant-garde circles. <P>
