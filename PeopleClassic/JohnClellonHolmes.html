John Clellon Holmes, a sometime-member of the crowd of friends that would 
become famous as the 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A>, 
wrote the first published works to herald their significance.  Less 
controversial and experimental than
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> or 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>, 
Holmes had the sensitivity to realize that their confused values and poignant
ambitions were symbolic of something outside their small universe, and
he published a novel, 
'Go'
(1952), which presented characters based on Kerouac, Ginsberg and

years before more famous works like

would be released. <P>

Holmes had met Jack Kerouac at a party, and the two promising young novelists
struck up a friendship on the basis of their interest in writing.  In 1948, 
Holmes had pressed Jack Kerouac to describe the unique qualities of his 
generation, and Kerouac invented the term 'Beat Generation' on the spot.  In
1952, after the publication of 'Go,' Holmes wrote an article for the New
York Times Magazine, 'This is the Beat Generation,' in which he introduced 
this phrase to the world.  Check out

for more on the origin of this term.  <P> 

John Clellon Holmes remained close friends with Jack Kerouac until Kerouac's
death in 1969.  There are some poignant stories in Barry Gifford's oral
biography "Jack's Book" about some of Jack's last, lonely visits to
Old Saybrook to enjoy the domestic pleasures of Holmes' quieter existence
with his wife.  Holmes died in 1988, leaving behind three novels and
several books of poetry, essays and memoirs. <P>
