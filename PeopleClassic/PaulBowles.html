<H1>Paul Bowles</H1>

<P>Paul Bowles was born in New York City on December 30, 1910. He was an
only child and exhibited early the existentialist's sense of alienation.
</P>

<P>Who was his father? The patriarchal figures in his stories are often
brutal. The true stories of Bowles paints the pictures of a cold, New York-Edwardian
man as his father-- but not exactly cruel or abusive.</P>

<P>Paul Bowles studied with composer Aaron Copland. Bowles went on to produce
a number of still-produced mostly-orchestral pieces. Later he wrote music
for the work of Tenessee Williams, a friend and supporter of the talents
of both Paul and his wife <A HREF="...JBowles.html">Jane</A>. </P>

<P>In his early creative years, prose interested him less than music. When
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/acorn/pomes/dama.html">Gertrude
Stein</A> told him he was &quot;not a real poet,&quot; he agreed. At the
time his artistic priorities were musical.</P>

<P>On the personal front, Bowles considered himself a Romantic in the creative
but not the sexual sense. He hated, for example, D.H. Lawrence's view of
sex as magical, even religious. Sex and gender distinctions were interesting
if irrelevent. And like Sartre, Bowles believed that somewhere out there
was a magic place or state of mind, a place that would deliver them into
the ecstasy of personal revelation. Bowles (like Sartre in <I>La Nausea</I>)
dreamed of finding it. To a large --at least symbolic-- degree, Bowles
found what he was looking for in his first trip to 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>,
Morocco (like Sartre).</P>

<P>Delicate and in ill-health, he returned to New York City where he met
and married 
<A HREF="../People/JaneBowles.html">Jane Auer</A> 
(later 
<A HREF="../People/JaneBowles.html">Jane
Bowles</A>). 
Like Virginia and Leonard Woolf's relationship some years
before, theirs at least began as sexual. That it was an intellectual soul-mating
can never be doubted. But how <I>
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/acorn/germ/married.html">married</A></I>
was their marriage? How sexual was it? </P>

<P>The couple traveled extensively but didn't return to North Africa until
sixteen years after his first visit. </P>

<P>In Tangier, largely inspired by Jane's literary career, Paul wrote <B><I>The
Sheltering Sky</I></B>. It was published in 1949 and made into a movie
in 1990. In 1950, his second novel, <B><I>The Delicate Prey</I></B>
was published; in 1952, <B><I>Let It Come Down</I></B>; and 
in 1955, <B><I>The Spider's House</I></B>. He continued 
writing music, including the score
for Tennessee Williams' <I>Summer and Smoke</I>. His prolific writing career
has continued with published collections of short stories, a wonderful
autobiography (<B><I>Without Stopping</I></B>, which describes his meetings
with many people pivotal to the 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A>),
travel and poetry books, as well as translations, most notably the enigmatic
tales of Moroccan Mohammed Mrabet.</P>

<P><I>He reached along the rail for her hand, but she pulled it away, 
saying, "I'm still talking to you. I expect you to be crazy, and I expect
to give into you all along. I'm crazy too, I know. But I wish there
were some way I could just once feel that my giving in meant anything
to you. I wish you knew how to be gracious about it."</I></P>

<P><I>"You think you humor me so much? I haven't noticed
it." His voice was sullen.</I></P>

<P><I>"I don't HUMOR you at all. I'm just trying to live with you
on an extended boat trip in a lot of cramped and little cabins on an endless
series of stinking boats."<BR>
--Paul Bowles 'Call at Corazon'</I></P>
