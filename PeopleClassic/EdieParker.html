<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
and that whole 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>
crowd when they were students there in the early forties.  
She was close friends with 
<A HREF="../People/JoanVollmerAdams.html">Joan Vollmer Adams</A>,
later the common-law wife (and shooting victim) of 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>,
and the two young women kept an off-campus apartment together where

Michigan with her for a few months before he split for good.  They had
no children together.  Edie would go on to write her memoirs under the
