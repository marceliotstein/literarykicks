<H1>William S. Burroughs</H1>

Born: February 5, 1914 <BR>
Place of Birth: St. Louis, Missouri<P>

<I>August 3, 1997: I just heard the news that Burroughs has died.  I'm trying
to gather some information about this now, which I'll put
<A HREF="../BurroughsTribute.html">here</A>.</I><P>

William Seward Burroughs was the grandson of the founder of the Burroughs
Adding Machine company, which evolved into the Burroughs Corporation
and not too long ago merged with Sperry Univac to form Unisys. (I 
could hyperlink this to comp.ancient.mainframes or something, but I think
I'll skip this link). <P>

Burroughs grew up in 
<A HREF="../Places/StLouis.html">St. Louis</A>,
where his upper-class midwestern background did not suit his tastes.
A bookworm with strong homoerotic urges, a fascination with guns and crime
and a natural inclination to break every rule he could find, there 
seemed to be no way Burroughs could ever fit into normal society.  
His parents seemed to accept this, and after he graduated from Harvard 
they continued to support him financially as he experimented with 
various lifestyles.<P>

In his early thirties he traveled to New York and decided to pursue freedom 
by joining the city's gangster underworld.  He became a heroin addict quite 
intentionally, in the process meeting the prototypical junkie drifter 
and future Beat hero 
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke</A>.
His St. Louis friends  
David Kammerer and
<A HREF="../People/LucienCarr.html">Lucien Carr</A> 
introduced him to a crowd of crazed young nonconformists studying at 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>,
including 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> 
and Burroughs' future common-law wife, 
<A HREF="../People/JoanVollmerAdams.html">Joan Vollmer Adams</A>.  
He was older than them, but they were impressed by his obvious intelligence 
and worldly cynicism.  Kerouac described him as 'Tall, 6 foot 1, strange, 
inscrutable because ordinary looking (scrutable), like a shy bank clerk with a 
patrician thinlipped cold bluelipped face.' <P>

His Columbia friends, particularly Kerouac and Ginsberg, were
interested in Burroughs' underworld experimentation, though they would not
follow him very far into it.  Kerouac and Ginsberg had writing careers to keep 
themselves busy; by his mid-thirties William S. Burroughs had still not begun
to write.<P>

But everybody who hung around with Ginsberg and Kerouac ended up writing
something.  At first indifferent to serious literary ideals, Burroughs wrote
'<A HREF="../Books/Junky.html">Junky</A>,'
a heroin-tinged autobiography, and allowed
Ginsberg to arrange for it's publication as a pulp paperback
by Ace Books, run by the uncle of Ginsberg's friend 
<A HREF="../People/CarlSolomon.html">Carl Solomon</A>.  
Burroughs followed this by a similar study of his homosexuality,
'Queer,' but this was too much even for the pulps, and would not be
published for decades.<P>

By this time Burroughs had already relocated to East Texas to try to
live as a farmer, growing oranges, cotton and marijuana.  Herbert Huncke
and Joan Vollmer Adams joined him, and they all lived together in a state 
of drug-addled squalor while running the farm and raising two children, one 
from Joan's first marriage and one the child of Joan and Bill.  Kerouac
visited with 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A> 
and others, and later described the wild scene in 
<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>.
Pursued by the law for his drug activities, Burroughs took Joan and the
children to 
<A HREF="../Places/Mexico.html">Mexico</A>,
and it was there that he committed the thoughtless act that would 
change his life.  Trying to show off his marksmanship to a couple of friends,
he announced that he was going to do his William Tell act.  Joan put a 
glass on her head, and he killed her with a single shot.<P>

Their son went to live with Burroughs' parents, and Burroughs wandered 
the world from South America to 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>.  
He was living in Tangier while his New York friends were becoming 
a popular sensation as the 
'<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A>',
first in 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A> 
and then all over America and the world.  
The writers
<A HREF="../People/PaulBowles.html">Paul</A> and 
<A HREF="../People/JaneBowles.html">Jane Bowles</A> 
lived in Tangier too, and Tangier soon became a popular literary escape
for new American celebrity writers, including Ginsberg and Kerouac.
Kerouac didn't like Tangier, but he was knocked out by the messy pile of stories
Burroughs had been idly writing, and he and Ginsberg helped to type them up.
Kerouac also suggested a name for the whole thing:
'<A HREF="../Books/NakedLunch.html">Naked Lunch</A>.' <P>

'Naked Lunch' made Burroughs an underground celebrity, and is widely 
considered his best work.  He would go on to write many more books, plays, 
film scripts and essays.  He went through a "cut-up" phase after 'Naked Lunch' 
during which he tried to compose novels from snippets of various texts.  
Not originally considered one of the Beat writers at all (in 1971, Bruce Cook
wrote an important study of the Beat Generation in which he listed the top
three Beat writers as Kerouac, Ginsberg and 
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>),
he is now a favorite to some, and hated by many more.  Some women's groups 
find him offensive (for good reason; he has published many nasty 
generalizations about women).  In the early 90's, there was a zine
devoted exclusively to disgust with Burrough's gender-based offenses. <P> 

I must confess that, while I admire his humor and talent with words, I find 
him the least appealing of the major Beat figures.  Maybe this is because of 
his essential creepiness; it is a telling fact that he was the only major 
Beat figure not strongly influenced by 
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhist</A>
thought.  Still, I admire the crystalline clarity and raw power of his 
writing.  I also like his strong emphasis on personal freedom, even if I 
sometimes don't care for the things Burroughs chooses to do with his freedom.<P>

A film of 'Naked Lunch',
directed by the very talented David Cronenberg, earned
Burroughs much attention in the early 90's.  
He has been cited as an inspiration 
by many 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatsInRock.html">rock musicians</A>,
and both the influential 
London psychedelic-scene band The Soft Machine and the American 70's
jazz-rock band Steely Dan took their names from Burroughs' writings.  
In 1992 Kurt Cobain 
released an album with Burroughs, 
'The Priest They Called Him' 
in which Cobian plays electric guitar over Burrough's spoken voice.  
It is shocking to realize that Burroughs would go on to outlive 
Kurt Cobain. <P>

Burroughs is well-represented on the internet.  While he has 
a strong literary presence in the world of Beat and post-Beat
writers, he also stands separately as a part of the wave of pop-culture media 
philosophers that flourished in the 60's, along with Timothy Leary, Marshall 
McLuhan, Andy Warhol, Alvin Toffler, etc.   The internet has
a natural affinity for these media-conscious thinkers, and it's not
surprising to see so many web sites devoted especially to Burroughs.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.hyperreal.com/wsb/">one I visit most often</A> 
has been run by Malcolm Humes since 1994.  
Luke Kelly's 
<A HREF="http://www.bigtable.com/wsb/">Big Table</A> 
site has some great Burroughs stuff, including a web-based
<A HREF="http://www.bigtable.com/wsb/cutups.html">cut-up machine.</A> 
I've also been impressed by 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~garms/wsb.html">this general WSB site</A>.
Check all these sites for other Burroughs links, of which there are no 
end.<P>
