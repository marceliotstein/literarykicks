<H1>Lucien Carr</H1>

Lucien Carr was one of several fascinating real-life characters, like 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>,
<A HREF="../People/CarlSolomon.html">Carl Solomon</A>,
and 
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke</A>, 
who became legendary through their association with the Beat
writers.  Lucien holds a special position here: he introduced 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A> and
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> 
to each other. <P>

An extraordinarily bright and adventuresome tousled-blond intellectual from
<A HREF="../Places/StLouis.html">St. Louis</A>,
he enrolled at
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A> 
in the early 1940's. 
Living in the dorms at the Union Theological Seminary, he put on a Brahms record
one day, thus earning a knock on the door from another eager young intellectual,
Allen Ginsberg.  They became close friends, and Carr introduced Ginsberg to the 
brewing Bohemian universe of 1940's 
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">Greenwich Village</A>.  
Lucien had a female friend, Columbia student Edie Parker, who was dating the 
recently-expelled Jack Kerouac.  Lucien and Edie decided to introduce Kerouac 
and Ginsberg, figuring (quite correctly) that the two would find much in 
common. <P>

Carr was heterosexual but prone to adoration from men, and an older man from
St. Louis, David Kammerer, had come to New York to pursue him.  One day 
Kammerer introduced Carr and Ginsberg to another visitor from St. Louis, 
William S. Burroughs.  Burroughs and Kerouac and Ginsberg had finally found each 
other, and began the weird escapades that would soon exhaust even Lucien 
Carr's energy and interest.  Carr had his own problems, too.  David
Kammerer's obsessive pursuit of him had become so overbearing it was ruining his
life, and Kammerer had begun to physically threaten Carr.  One day Carr 
impulsively stabbed Kammerer to death by the Hudson River in Riverside Park, 
near the Columbia campus. <P>

Terrified, he enlisted Burroughs and Kerouac to help him evade the law, and then
after consulting his family turned himself in to the police.  The episode 
disgraced Columbia University, and Keroauc and Ginsberg would both suffer for
their association with the crime (Burroughs had already been associated with enough
crimes for this to have much less impact on him).  Kerouac would
write about this episode in both his first novel, 
'<A HREF="../Books/TownAndCity.html">The Town and the City</A>' 
and his last,
'Vanity of Duluoz.'<P> 

Carr served two years in jail, and afterwards did something that completely
violated Beat ethics and disgusted his friends.  He got a job.  Beginning as
a reporter for the United Press wire service, he remained with them until the 
present time, advancing to increasingly senior positions.  It was supposed to 
have been a roll of Lucien's teletype paper from the United Press that Kerouac
used to type his legendary unbroken-sheet early draft of 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>' 
(although other accounts say it was a roll of wallpaper). <P>

Lucien never pursued a "Beat" career, though he had a good understanding of 
literature and introduced many of his Columbia friends to the works of 
<A HREF="../People/ArthurRimbaud.html">Rimbaud</A>.  Carr stayed in touch with
Kerouac and Ginsberg, but did not like it when they wrote about him or 
included his name in dedications.<P>

Lucien's son Caleb Carr is currently receiving much attention for his mysterious
novel 'The Alienist.'  Caleb Carr met many of the Beats as a young man, though
he claims to have received no literary inspiration from them or from his father.
There may be more to this than meets the eye, however; 'The Alienist' is about
a series of murders that take place on Manhattan's waterfront in the distant 
past.<P>
