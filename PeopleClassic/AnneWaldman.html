<H1>Anne Waldman</H1>

Born: April 2, 1945<BR>
Place of Birth: Millville, New Jersey<P>

Anne Waldman was part of the late Sixties poetry scene in the
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">East Village</A>.  She
ran the St. Mark's Church Poetry Project, and gave exuberant, 
highly physical readings of her own work.  <P>

She became a 
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhist</A>, 
worshipping with the Tibetan 
Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, 
who would also become 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>'s 
guru.  She and Ginsberg worked together to create a poetry school, 
the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, at Trungpa's 
<A HREF="../Places/Naropa.html">Naropa Institute</A> 
in Boulder, Colorado. <P>

Anne Waldman is one of the most interesting, vibrant and unpredictable members of
the 
<A HREF="../Topics/LatterDayBeats.html">post-Beat poetry community</A>.
Her confluence of Buddhist concerns and thought-paths with sources of
physicality and anger is particularly impressive (did you get all that?).<P>

She was featured in 
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/employees/howells/dylan.html">Bob Dylan</A>'s
experimental film
'<A HREF="../Films/RenaldoAndClara.html">Renaldo and Clara</A>.'
