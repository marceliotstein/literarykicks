<H1>Jane Bowles</H1>

<UL>
<P><I>The farther a man follows the rainbow, the harder it is for him to
get back to the life which he left starving like an old dog. Sometimes
when a man gets older he has a revelation and wants awfully bad to get
back to the place where he left his life, but he can't get back to that
place-- not often. It's always better to stay alongside of your life.<BR>
--Jane Bowles 'Plain Pleasures'</I></P>
</UL>

<P>Jane Auer was born in New York City on February 22, 1917 and raised
mostly on Long Island. At twenty-one, she married Manhattanite 
<A HREF="../PaulBowles.html">Paul Bowles</A>. 
After the civil ceremony, they took off for Panama. According
to Paul Bowles' autobiography <I>Without Stopping</I>, Jane Bowles
saw enough in Panama in ten days to enable her to use it as a locale for
her first novel, <B><I>Two Serious Ladies</I></B>, which was published
in 1943. From 1947, she lived abroad, mostly in 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>,
with her husband, writer and composer 
<A HREF="../People/PaulBowles.html">Paul Bowles</A>.</P>

<P>In 1954, Jane's play <B><I>In the Summer House</I></B> was produced.
It was met with acclaim from the less conventional (including Tennessee
Williams). She wrote short stories, a novella, and in 1966, her final novel,
<B><I>Plain Pleasures</I></B>.</P>

<P>Her work was subjected to much criticism, possibly because of its subtle
nature. She took the criticism good-naturedly, although she drank heavily.
Her life was like 
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/acorn/germ/sisters.html">Virginia Woolf's</A> 
in ways-- an unconventional marriage, battles with moods and
self-image, and the lesbian attractions. </P>

<P>Jane's health deteriorated until it became necessary for her loving
husband to institutionalize her in nearby Spain. She died on May 4, 1973,
and when she did, her husband said he lost his interest in writing fiction.
Who now did he have to read it to and share ideas? Her works, all marked
with a dry wit and a quirky intelligence, have yet to earn the respect
they deserve.</P>
