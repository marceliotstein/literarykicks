<H1>Carolyn Cassady</H1>

Carolyn Robinson studied at Bennington College, the expensive liberal-arts
school in Vermont that recently produced the excellent novelist Donna Tartt
and several less-than excellent novelists as well (Hi, Bret). 
After graduating from Bennington, she enrolled as a graduate student 
at the University of 
<A HREF="../Places/Denver.html">Denver</A>.
But Denver was the stomping ground of 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>,
and it's fun to imagine the startling change of direction her life must have
taken once Neal swept her up in his arms.  <P>

Neal and Carolyn married, had children, and lived together through the fifties
and early sixties.  She was represented often in the novels of 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>,
who appears to have respected and loved her more than was characteristic for
him.  After Neal and Jack died, some of Carolyn's memoirs about her relationship
with both men were published as a book, 'Heart Beat.' 
This was made into 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Boards/viewBoard.jsp?forum=4">a movie</A> 
starring Sissy Spacek, Nick
Nolte and John Heard.  Later, Carolyn wrote the more complete story of her
life with Neal and his Beat friends, and this fascinating book, "Off The Road," 
stands as one of an unofficial trilogy of popular memoirs 
by the women the Beats loved and too often ignored, along with Joyce 
Johnson's "Minor Characters" and "How I Became Hettie Jones" by Amiri 
Baraka's ex-wife Hettie Jones.<P> 

Both Carolyn and Neal were influenced by the latter-day Western mystic
Edgar Cayce, who was popular in their era.  Both Kerouac and
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
discouraged Neal from his interest in Cayce's teachings,
considering it not much more spiritual than
astrology and a low-rent bastardization of Eastern 
thought.  Carolyn, however remained interested in 
and respectful of "Caycean" thought long after Neal's death.  
Two Edgar Cayce websites, one
<A HREF="http://www.edgar-cayce.com/">official</A>
and one from
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5692/">Geocities</A>,
give an interesting first-hand peek at this once-thriving 
quasi-religous 20th Century phenomenon.<P>

Carolyn is now living in England, but often visits the United States to
visit her 
<A HREF="../JCI/JCInterview.html">son</A>
and daughters, and to participate in Beat-related conferences and events.<P>

Tim Bowden has written a wonderful 
<A HREF="../Topics/BowdenOnCarolyn.html">memoir of his relationship with Carolyn</A>
a few years after Neal's death.<P>
