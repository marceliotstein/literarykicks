Born: March 26, 1930  <BR>
Place of Birth: New York City <P>

Gregory Corso, the only major Beat writer to have the forethought to actually 
be <I>born</I> on Bleecker Street in 
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">Greenwich Village</A>, 
was sent to prison on a robbery charge at the age of 16.  He
probably would not have made poetry his life's work if he had not met 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A> 
in a Greenwich Village Bar when he was 20.  Ginsberg was 
impressed by the poetry Corso had written in prison and alerted others to
his talent.  Corso's first poems were published in 1955. <P>

He went on to become one of the most well-known and widely-read Beat poets.
He has an anarchic style similar to Ginsberg's, though his favorite
poet is Shelley, a Romantic poet who was much too flowery for most Beats.  
He does not write with Ginsberg's massive intelligence or protean poetic power, but 
then who does?  He once wrote a love-poem to atomic weapons, 
'<A HREF="../Texts/Bomb.html">BOMB</A>',
in the shape of a mushroom cloud. <P>

More famous then than he is now, he has a standing alongside   
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>, 
Allen Ginsberg and
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> 
that is sort of comparable to Zeppo's standing alongside Groucho, Harpo
and Chico.  That is, he isn't one of the big three, but if you want
a big four he's the fourth.  (Or is 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A> 
the fourth?  Ah, forget this whole dumb paragraph.) <P>

Corso's sense of humor is evident in his work, and this is a
refreshing difference from the other Beats, most of whom were
never known for acheiving a 'light' tone.  An excellent example of
this is Corso's excellent 
'<A HREF="../Texts/Marriage.html">Marriage</A>.'
I like this poem a lot, maybe because I'm a married guy myself, or 
maybe just because I admire its simple human honesty.  For all his
odd characteristics, this poem seems to indicate that Corso was
at heart a 'regular guy' (one who occasionally cries out for 
penguin dust, perhaps, but regular nonetheless).<P>

Corso appears as Yuri Gregorovic, the guy who steals Jack Kerouac's girlfriend 
in Kerouac's somewhat self-pitying novel 
'The Subterraneans.' <P>
