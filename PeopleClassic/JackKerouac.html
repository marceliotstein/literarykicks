Born: March 12, 1922 <BR>
Place of Birth: Lowell, Massachusetts <BR>
Died: October 21, 1969 <BR>
Place of Death: St. Petersburg, Florida <P>

Jack Kerouac was born Jean-Louis Kerouac, a French-Canadian child in 
working-class 
<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A>, 
Massachusetts.  <I>Ti Jean</I> spoke a local dialect of French called 
<I>joual</I> before he learned English.  The youngest of three children, he 
was heartbroken when his older brother Gerard died of rheumatic fever
at the age of nine. <P>

<I>Ti Jean</I> was an intense and serious child, devoted to 
<I>Memere</I> (his mother) and constantly forming important 
friendships with other boys, as he would continue to do throughout his life.  
He was driven to create stories from a young age, inspired first by the 
mysterious radio show 'The Shadow,' and later by the fervid novels of 
<A HREF="../People/ThomasWolfe.html">Thomas Wolfe</A>, 
the writer he would model himself after. <P> 

Lowell had once thrived as the center of New England's textile industry, but 
by the time of Kerouac's birth it had begun to sink into poverty.
Kerouac's father, a printer and well-known local businessman, began to 
suffer financial difficulties, and started gambling in the hope of restoring 
prosperity to the household.  Young Jack hoped to save the family himself
by winning a football scholarship to college and entering the insurance 
business.  He was a star back on his high school team and won some miraculous 
victories, securing himself a scholarship to
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A> in New York. 
His parents followed him there, settling in Ozone Park, Queens.   <P>

Things went wrong at Columbia.  Kerouac fought with the football coach, who
refused to let him play.  His father lost his business and sank rapidly 
into alcoholic helplessness, and young Jack, disillusioned and confused,
dropped out of Columbia, bitterly disappointing the father who had so recently
disappointed him.  He tried and failed to fit in with the military (World War 
II had begun) and ended up sailing with the Merchant Marine.  When he wasn't 
sailing, he was hanging around New York with a crowd his parents did 
not approve of: depraved young Columbia students 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A> and 
<A HREF="../People/LucienCarr.html">Lucien Carr</A>,    
a strange but brilliant older downtown friend named 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>, 
and a joyful street cowboy from 
<A HREF="../Places/Denver.html">Denver</A> named 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>.  <P>

Kerouac had already begun writing a novel, stylistically reminiscent of Thomas
Wolfe, about the torments he was suffering as he tried to balance his 
wild city life with his old-world family values.  His friends loved the 
manuscript, and Ginsberg asked his Columbia professors to help find a 
publisher for it.  It would become Kerouac's first and most conventional novel, 
'<A HREF="../Books/TownAndCity.html">The Town and the City</A>,'
which earned him respect and some recognition as a writer, although it
did not make him famous.<P>

It would be a long time before he would be published again.  He had 
taken some amazing cross-country trips with Neal Cassady while working
on his novel, and in his attempt to write about these trips he had begun 
experimenting with freer forms of writing, partly inspired by 
the unpretentious, spontaneous prose he found in 
<A HREF="../Texts/CassadyLetter.html">Neal Cassady's letters</A>.  
He decided to write about his cross-country trips exactly as they had
happened, without pausing to edit, fictionalize or even think.
He presented the resulting manuscript to his editor on a single long
roll of unbroken paper, but the editor did not share his enthusiasm
and the relationship was broken.  Kerouac would suffer seven years 
of rejection before 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>'
would be published.<P>

He spent the early 1950's writing one unpublished novel after another, 
carrying them around in a rucksack as he roamed back and forth across the 
country.  He followed Ginsberg and Cassady to 
<A HREF="../Places/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</A> and
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>,
where he became close friends with the young Zen poet 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>.
He found enlightenment through the 
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhist religion</A> 
and tried to follow Snyder's lead in communing with nature.  His 
excellent novel
'<A HREF="../Books/DharmaBums.html">The Dharma Bums</A>' 
describes a joyous mountain climbing trip he and Snyder went on 
in Yosemite in 1955, and captures the tentative, sometimes comic
steps he and his friends were taking towards spiritual realization.<P>

His fellow starving writers were beginning to attract fame as the 
'<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A>'
a label Kerouac had invented years earlier during a conversation 
with fellow novelist
<A HREF="../People/JohnClellonHolmes.html">John Clellon Holmes</A>.
Ginsberg and Snyder became underground celebrities in 1955 after the
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A> 
poetry reading in San Francisco.  Since they and many of their friends 
regularly referred to Kerouac as the most talented writer among them, 
publishers began to express interest in the forlorn, unwanted manuscripts 
he carried in his rucksack wherever he went.
'On The Road' was finally published in 1957, and when it 
became a tremendous popular success Kerouac did not know how to react.  
Embittered by years of rejection, he was suddenly expected to snap to and play 
the part of Young Beat Icon for the public.  He was older and sadder than 
everyone expected him to be, and probably far more intelligent as well.
Literary critics, objecting to the Beat 'fad,' refused to take Kerouac 
seriously as a writer and began to ridicule his work, hurting him
tremendously.  Certainly the Beat Generation was a fad, Kerouac knew, but 
his own writing was not.<P>

His sudden celebrity was probably the worst thing that could have 
happened to him, because his moral and spiritual decline in the next few 
years was shocking.  Trying to live up to the wild image he'd presented in
'On The Road,' he developed a severe drinking habit that dimmed his 
natural brightness and aged him prematurely.  His Buddhism failed him, or 
he failed it.  He could not resist a drinking binge, and his friends began 
viewing him as needy and unstable.  He published many books during these 
years, but most had been written earlier, during the early 50's when he could
not find a publisher.  He kept busy, appearing on TV shows, writing magazine 
articles and recording three spoken-word albums, but his momentum as a serious
writer had been completely disrupted. <P>

Like 
<A HREF="http://www.luth.se/nirvana">Kurt Cobain</A>,
another counter-culture celebrity who seemed to be truly (as opposed to 
fashionably) miserable, Kerouac expressed his unhappiness nakedly in his art 
and was not taken seriously.  In 1961 he tried to break his drinking 
habit and rediscover his writing talents with a solitary nature retreat in 
<A HREF="../Places/BigSurPlace.html">Big Sur</A>.  
Instead, the vast nature around him creeped him out and he returned 
to San Francisco to drink himself into oblivion.  He was cracking up, and
he laid out the entire chilling experience in his last great novel,
'<A HREF="../Books/BigSurBook.html">Big Sur</A>.'<P>

Defeated and lonesome, he left California to live with his mother in Long 
Island, and would not stray from his mother for the rest of his life.  
He would continue to publish, and remained mentally alert and aware (though 
always drunken).  But his works after 'Big Sur' displayed a disconnected soul, 
a human being sadly lost in his own curmudgeonly illusions.<P>

Despite the 'beatnik' stereotype, Kerouac was a political conservative, 
especially when under the influence of his Catholic mother.  As the beatniks 
of the 1950's began to yield their spotlight to the hippies of the 1960's, 
Jack took pleasure in standing against everything the hippies stood for.  He 
supported the Vietnam War and became friendly with William F. Buckley.  <P>

Living alone with his mother in Northport, Long Island, 
Kerouac developed a fascinating set of habits.  He stayed in his
house most of the time and carried on a lifelong game of 'baseball' with
a deck of playing cards.  His drink of choice was a jug of the kind of
cheap, sweet wine, Tokay or Thunderbird, usually preferred by winos.  He 
became increasingly devoted to Catholicism, but his unusual Buddhist-tinged 
brand of Catholicism would hardly have met with the approval of the Pope. <P>

Through his first forty years Kerouac had failed to sustain a long-term 
romantic relationship with a woman, though he often fell in love.  
He'd married twice, to 
<A HREF="../People/EdieParker.html">Edie Parker</A> and 
<A HREF="../People/JoanHaverty.html">Joan Haverty</A>, 
but both marriages had ended within months.  In the mid-1960's he married again,
but this time to a maternalistic and older childhood acquaintance from 
small-town Lowell, 
<A HREF="../People/StellaSampas.html">Stella Sampas</A>, 
who he hoped would help around the house as his mother entered old age.  <P>

He moved back to Lowell with Stella and his mother, and then 
moved again with them to St. Petersburg, Florida.  His health destroyed by 
drinking, he died at home in 1969. He was 47 years old. <P>
