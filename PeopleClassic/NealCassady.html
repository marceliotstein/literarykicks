The real genius behind the Beat movement in literature never published a 
book during his life.  He appeared as a main character in many books, though, 
from 
'Go' by 
<A HREF="../People/JohnClellonHolmes.html">John Clellon Holmes</A> to 
<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">'On The Road'</A> by
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> to 
'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test' by 
Tom Wolfe.  
His free-flowing letter writing style inspired the young Kerouac to break his 
ties to the sentimental style he'd picked up from  
<A HREF="../People/ThomasWolfe.html">Thomas Wolfe</A>
and invent his notion of 'spontaneous prose.'  Without Neal Cassady, the 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A> 
would never have happened. <P>

Neal Cassady was raised by an alcoholic father in the skid row hotels of 
<A HREF="../Places/Denver.html">Denver</A>'s
Larimer Street.  A car thief with a unique ability to charm strangers,
he spent time in reform schools and juvenile prisons and developed the suave
instincts of a con artist, although he never seemed to want to con anybody out
of more than a ten-dollar bill, a roll in the hay or a good conversation. <P>

A friend named Hal Chase left Denver to enroll at 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>, 
and Cassady traveled to New York to visit him in December 1946.  It was here
that he met Kerouac and Ginsberg. Ginsberg immediately fell in love with him, 
and Cassady, who had a hustler's instinct to be whatever the person he's with 
wants him to be, began a sexual relationship with Ginsberg, balancing it with 
the numerous heterosexual relationships he enjoyed more.  At the same time, 
he persuaded Kerouac to teach him how to write fiction. <P>

Soon he and Kerouac began the series of cross-country adventures that would 
later become 'On The Road'.  They raced aimlessly across the U.S.A. and 
<A HREF="../Places/Mexico.html">Mexico</A>,
with Cassady setting the agenda.  Kerouac began writing about their adventures 
even as they were taking place, but he could not find a style that fit the 
content, and put the project away in frustration. <P> 

He picked the project up again later, after a series of letters from Cassady
gave Kerouac the idea to write the book the way Cassady talked, in a 
rush of mad ecstasy, without self-consciousness or mental hesitation.  It 
worked: 'On The Road' became a sensation by capturing Cassady's voice. <P>

Cassady married several women and fathered many children (much of this activity
is discussed in 'On The Road').  He finally settled down with 
<A HREF="../People/CarolynCassady.html">Carolyn Cassady</A>
in Los Gatos, a suburb near San Jose, where he worked as a brakeman on the 
Southern Pacific 
railroad.  He remained close friends with Ginsberg, Kerouac and many
others from the Beat crowd, although he never profited from their eventual 
success.  Kerouac wrote in 
'Desolation Angels' 
of the strange way he felt when Cassady dropped by his
apartment after the first advance copies of 'On The Road' arrived: 

<I><BLOCKQUOTE>
When Cody said goodbye to all of us that day he for the first time in our 
lives failed to look me a goodbye in the eye but looked away shifty-like --
I couldn't understand it and still don't -- I knew something was bound to
be wrong and it turned out very wrong ...
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>

In the 1960's, as Kerouac withdrew into alcoholism and early middle-age, 
Cassady began an entirely new series of road adventures, this time with young 
novelist 
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey</A> 
in Jack Kerouac's place.  When Kesey organized a trip to the New York
World's Fair in a psychedelic bus named 'Furthur,' Neal Cassady was the 
madman behind the wheel.  This trip is chronicled in Tom Wolfe's 
'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.'  <P>

When Kesey and Cassady were in New York, a party was organized for the purpose 
of introducing Kerouac to Kesey.  But Kerouac and Cassady had been changing in 
opposite directions, and the meeting did not go well, especially after 
Kerouac, offended by somebody's frivolous treatment of an American 
flag, solemnly rescued the flag and folded it. <P> 

After a night of hard partying in Mexico in 1968, Cassady wandered onto a 
deserted railroad, intending to walk fifteen miles to the next town.  
He fell asleep on the way, wearing only a t-shirt and jeans.  It was a cold
rainy night, and Cassady was found beside the tracks the next morning.  He 
was in a coma, and died in a hospital later that day.  Kerouac would die a 
year later. <P>  

Neal's unfinished autobiography was published as 'The First Third'
after his death.  Some of his letters, such as the one Kerouac called 
'<A HREF="../Texts/CassadyLetter.html">The Great Sex Letter</A>,'
were also published.  <P>

I'm proud to be able to bring you John Perry Barlow's wonderful
write-up about his 
<A HREF="../Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html">memories of Neal Cassady</A> 
and the song he wrote about him. <P>

In the autumn and winter of 1995 I conducted an extensive 
<A HREF="../JCI/JCInterview.html">e-mail interview</A>
with John Cassady, Neal's son. <P>

Here's 
<A HREF="http://www.ridgetelnet.com/BBTTRWB/Cassady.htm">another interview</A>
(conducted by Bill Horbaly, a Cassady
relative himself) with several of Neal's adult children.<P>

Andrew Burnett wrote a heartfelt tribute to the city of Denver 
and the streets Neal Cassady walked.  It's illustrated with many
photos of places mentioned in the Beat classics.  Here's 
<A HREF="../Denver/index.html">Neal's Denver</A>.<P>

A list of books, tapes, videos and other things relating to Neal is
<A HREF="../Lists/CassadyQuest.html">here</A>.<P>

Finally, here is Tim Bowden's fascinating 
<A HREF="../Topics/BowdenOnCarolyn.html">memoir of his relationship with
Carolyn Cassady</A> a few years after Neal's death.  There are some 
interesting insights here, and we encounter quite a few marginal Beat 
legends and 'On The Road' characters as well.<P>
