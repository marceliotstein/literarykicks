<H1>Philip Whalen</H1>

Born: October 20, 1923 <BR>
Place of Birth: Portland, Oregon <P>

Philip Whalen was a roommate of future poets
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A> and
<A HREF="../People/LewWelch.html">Lew Welch</A>'s 
at 
<A HREF="../Places/ReedCollege.html">Reed College</A>
in Oregon.  (Shit, how come when I look back at
my old college roommates all I see is one lawyer, one salesman and
one eternal grad student?) <P>

Whalen did not pursue a career in poetry, but fell into it after 
Snyder asked him to take part in the famous
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A> poetry reading 
in 1955.  A good portrait of Whalen, Snyder's slightly older and 
chubbier Zen-poet friend, appears in 
'<A HREF="../Books/DharmaBums.html">The Dharma Bums</A>' by
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> (the 
character's name is Warren Coughlin). <P>

Like Snyder and Kerouac, Whalen took 
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhism</A>
very seriously, and also like them he found spiritual 
enlightenment as a fire lookout in the Cascade Mountains in 
the Pacific Northwest.  Whalen published many highly respected
works of poetry, and was ordained as a Zen monk in 1973. He 
has been suffering from severe eyesight problems in recent
years.  He continues to live as a Buddhist in San Francisco.<P>
