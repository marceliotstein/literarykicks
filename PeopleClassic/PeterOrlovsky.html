<H1>Peter Orlovsky</H1>

Peter Orlovsky was staying with painter Robert LaVigne in 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>
in 1954 when 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
dropped by for a visit.  The two fell together almost instantly, 
and remained a couple for three decades.  Their relationship had 
rocky periods and was 
never monogamous (Peter Orlovsky had heterosexual leanings, for one
thing), but it apparently survived, as a close and important 
friendship at least, until Ginsberg's death.  The relationship
apparently provided enormous inspiration for Ginsberg, and the
two were inseperable for much of the 50's, 60's and 70's.  <P>

Orlovsky has written and performed his own poetry, though he never 
fully established a literary identity for himself that transcended his status 
as Ginsberg's lover.  His poems have a charm and a certain logic, though,
and his legacy may someday find its own enthusiastic fan club. <P>

He can be seen romping in a meditation circle with Ginsberg, Mick Ronson, 
Roger McGuinn and many others in Bob Dylan's great but 
difficult-to-find 1997 movie
