<H1>Joan Haverty</H1>

Joan Haverty was the girlfriend of Bill Cannastra, a close friend of
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>'s, 
when Cannastra was suddenly killed in a bizarre subway train accident 
near the Bleecker Street station (he pretended to climb out the train
window while the train was moving, got stuck, and smashed into a pillar). 
Kerouac comforted Joan and, irrationally and impulsively, married her a 
month later.  She was twenty years old, and Jack was twenty-eight.  <P>

The marriage, Jack's second, lasted no longer than his first.  Joan gave   
birth to a daughter, but Jack denied the paternity and later fought long
legal battles to prevent any legal connection between himself and the child.
<A HREF="../People/JanKerouac.html">Jan Kerouac</A>
went on to write a well-regarded book, 'Baby Driver,' and it is now generally
accepted that she is indeed Jack's biological daughter. <P>
