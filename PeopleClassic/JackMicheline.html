Here's a true voice of the Beat Generation, a poet who has remained 
"underground" since he published his first book (River of Red Wine) in 
1958.  <P>

Jack Micheline has never been published by the bigger presses, and 
according to himself he never will. He thinks he's living in "Siberia 
in the United States" - the loveless hell of people trying to get by in 
this greedy world. You'll never see this guy in a shoe commercial - that's 
for sure!<p>

Jack Micheline was born in the Bronx as Harvey Martin Silver. The reason 
for the name change was his father, a postman in whom Micheline saw the 
money-grabbing that could be found everywhere in the ghetto. He never liked 
the cruelty and injustice in his own streets. So, like many before him, he 
went on the road.<p> 

He began his travelling at the age of seventeen and didn't stop until 
he was twenty-six. Now he found a home in the streets of 
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">Greenwich Village</A>, 
where he lived the next five years. Rapidly Micheline identified 
himself with the tradition of American street poets, such as Vachel 
Lindsay and Maxvell Bodenheim. He walked the streets of the Village 
and Harlem listening to 
<A HREF="../Topics/Jazz.html">jazz</A>, 
digging the vitality and humanity amongst 
poor people. He found a friend in the black poet Langston Hughes who 
encouraged him in his writing. In 1957 he also won the "Revolt 
in Literature Award" at the Half Note Club in the East Village 
(one of the judges was Charles Mingus). Shortly after that he showed
his poems to the publisher of Troubadour Press. He wanted to print 
them under two conditions: Micheline had to stagger his lines to make 
them look more unconventional, and get a famous person to write an 
introduction.  Micheline was then living in the same building as 
poet Howard Hart, who was sharing his apartment with...
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>!<p>

Micheline showed his poems to Kerouac who began yelling, "Wow! A new poet!"
Kerouac also wanted to write an introduction for the collection. Drunk 
and in a good spirit Kerouac wrote a page-long introduction. In Kerouac, 
Micheline also found a new friend.<p>

The book <i>River of Red Wine</i> was published in 1958. Soon Micheline 
found himself at fashionable literary and artistic parties, and just 
like Kerouac, he had a habit of getting drunk and trying to liven things 
up. He could run across the room shouting, "To be alive is to lead an 
exciting life!" or trying to get the proper girls into bed by using 
offensive language.<p>

After a while he got bored with the stiff parties and started to hang 
out with Kerouac instead. They would walk the Bowery, drinking and 
talking to the bums. Because of his new friendship with Kerouac and his 
writer friends, he now was a Beat, meaning he was being published in 
anthologies covering the Beats. He wrote a lot at this period, and 
most of it is still unpublished. In the early sixties he continued 
his travels across the States and kept getting rejected by the publishers. 
He lived in rooming houses, stayed with friends and got in touch with 
other underground artists. In 1963 he married a politician's daughter 
and went to Europe with her. Just a year later the marriage broke up. 
The reason was that an earlier girlfriend gave birth to a child that 
was Micheline's (it was a boy and is his only child). Now he 
lived alone in the Village again. He continued to write poetry, fiction 
and even plays.<p>

Micheline was an enthuastic participant in the counter-cultural 
movement of the sixties, but he realized quite early that the movement 
was being commercialized and wasn't going to make it all the way through. 
"They say we opened up society. What did we open up? We opened up the 
banks for some people in Hollywood." he said in the eighties.<p>

At the end of his life Micheline lived in 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>,
writing poetry and painting while still 
being ignored by the bigger presses. 
"Good work doesn't sell well they claim. I am a rare human spirit, 
the work is open, free and alive.  I'm sorry if I frighten them. Maybe 
they want stories with condoms on them, clean and safe. My work is 
ALIVE! This animal is alive. Sad for this unbrave world. Sad 
state indeed. It makes one scream..."<P>

He died on a BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train on February 27, 1998.
