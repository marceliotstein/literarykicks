<H1>Lenore Kandel</H1>

Lenore Kandel's first appearance in Beat history is as a character:
the sexy Ramona Swartz, who spends a spooky weekend in a cabin with
Jack Duluoz 
(<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>), 
Dave Wain
(<A HREF="../People/LewWelch.html">Lew Welch</A>),
and Duluoz's girlfriend Billie in Kerouac's sad novel 
'<A HREF="../Books/BigSurBook.html">Big Sur</A>.'<P>

In 1966 (five years after the events of the weekend with Kerouac and Welch),
Lenore Kandel became famous for her book of erotic poetry, 
'The Love Book.'  Like 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>,'
this work became a much bigger sensation than it would otherwise have
been when somebody tried to censor it.  It was the dawn of the 
psychedelic age in 
Haight-Ashbury,
Ronald Reagan had just been elected Governor of California on a platform
that included harassment of hippies, and so the Psychedelic Shop, the
most famous head shop on Haight St. (and perhaps the first head shop
in the world) was raided for selling obscene literature, namely, Kandel's 
book.<P>

I haven't found a copy of this book, but this is what Charles Perry writes
in his excellent Summer of Love history book 'The Haight-Ashbury':

Why Kandel's book was singled out as obscene was the subject of much
speculation.  The poems had already appeared in an anthology called
"The Erotic Revolution," which had been sold nationwide without any
trouble.  Certainly the poems were about sex, but in a rather romantic
and high-minded way for all the four-letter words they contained.  They
read as if Elizabeth Barrett Browning had taken acid and set about to
describe the sex act with relish as a cosmic event, identifying the 
lovers as the Divine Couple of Hindu mythology.  It was virtually a 
celebration of monogamy, and there was far coarser eroticism available
on newsstands and in bookstores all over San Francisco.
