William Blake<P>

William Blake was one of those 19th century figures who could have and should
have been beatniks, along with 
<A HREF="../People/ArthurRimbaud.html">Rimbaud</A>, 
Verlaine, Manet, Cezanne and 
<A HREF="../People/WaltWhitman.html">Whitman</A>.
He began his career as an engraver and artist, and was an
apprentice to the highly original Romantic painter Henry Fuseli.  
In his own time he was valued as an artist, and created a set of watercolor
illustrations for the Book of Job that were so wildly but subtly colored 
they would have looked perfectly at home in next month's issue of 
<I>Wired</I>.  <P>

He lived in a filthy London studio where he succumbed to constant visions
of angels and prophets who instructed him in his work.  He once painted while
recieving a vision of Voltaire, and when asked later whether Voltaire spoke 
English, replied: "To my sensations it was English.  It was like the touch of
a musical key.  He touched it probably French, but to my ear it became 
English."<P>

Blake is now revered for his poetry as well as his artworks.  
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>'s 
life was changed by a vision of Blake (it's kind of sweetly pretentious in a 
way, isn't it?) in a Lower East Side apartment.  Ginsberg now often includes 
a chant from a poem as part of his poetry readings; you can read it
