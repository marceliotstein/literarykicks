<H1>Stella Sampas</H1>

As a teenager in 
<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A>,
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
formed a close friendship with a sensitive Greek boy named
Sammy Sampas, who would die heroically in World War II (and who
was immortalized as Alexander in Kerouac's first novel, 
'<A HREF="../Books/TownAndCity.html">The Town and the City</A>.') <P>

Decades later, a famous and alcoholic Kerouac returned to Lowell
to marry Sammy's sister Stella, a matronly older woman.  He and Stella
do not appear to have been romantically linked when they were young.  This 
was Jack's third marriage, and the only one that lasted more than a few
months.  He and Stella lived with Jack's mother in Lowell, St. Petersburg, 
Florida, and Northport, Long Island.  She was with him on the morning of 
his death in 1969.  <P>

The large Sampas family is still very visible around Lowell, Massachusetts. <P>
