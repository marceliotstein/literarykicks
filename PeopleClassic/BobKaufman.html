Bob Kaufman was, other than Langston Hughes, the greatest 
<A HREF="../Topics/Jazz.html">jazz</A>
poet who ever lived.  He was one of 13 
children born to a German Jewish father and a Black Catholic mother.  He ran
away from home and joined the Merchant Marines when he was 13, and circled
the globe 9 times in the next 20 years.  During that period Kaufman read 
literature and met a fellow Merchant Marine,

who had been discharged from the Armed Forces after refusing to obey certain 
orders.  Kaufman later travelled to

where he joined

and others during their literary "renaissance." 
Kaufman was known in America as "the original bebop man" and was 
very popular in France, where he was known as "the Black American

Kaufman was so dedicated to the spontaneous, oral tradition of poetry 
that he sometimes would not write his work down, and only did so at the 
encouragement of his wife.  He would carry his son, Parker, into 
coffeehouses in San Francisco and "hold court," reciting his poems aloud 
and from memory.  It is claimed that he invented the word "beatnik," and 
his work is essentially improvised.  His work varies from Symbolist to 
Surrealist, and often involves political and social protest.  He was 
often persecuted by local authorities, and even given shock treatment 
against his will.  After difficulties with heroin, and prison terms, he 
began to experience a sense of solitude.  When Kennedy was assassinated 
in 1963, Kaufman took a Buddhist vow of silence to protest the Vietnam 
war which lasted for ten years.  During that period, until 1973, he 
neither spoke nor wrote anything.  On the day the war ended, he walked 
into a coffeeshop and recited a poem called "All Those Ships that Never 
Sailed."  <P>

In 1978, he withdrew again into solitude (but was not silent) for four 
years.  <P>

There is a special library at the Sorbonne in Paris which has the bulk of his 
"papers" and information about him.  He was much more popular in France than
in America.  He also published several "chapbooks" or "manifestos" 
for City Lights in the early to late sixties.  Those are completely 
unavailable, and "Golden Sardine" is out of print and only available at 
better libraries.  <P>

Kaufman's poems include love poems, jazz poems and odes to Hart 
Crane, Charlie Mingus, Ray Charles, and Albert Camus.  They often infuse 
jazz sounds and rhythms, and are meant to have musical accompaniment.  
He died in 1986.  He remains one of the best 2 or 3 of the Beat poets and 
the most underrated of all American poets.<P>
