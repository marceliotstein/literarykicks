Many writers have been called timeless, but Walt Whitman deserves this
description in a special way.  He invented himself in 1855 with a slim 
volume of poetry, 'Leaves of Grass,' that seemed to have come from 
nowhere and connected to nothing else that was being written at that
time or any other.  The poems were about himself, plain and simple,
especially the ecstatic 'Song Of Myself,' which celebrated the 
explosive joy of living inside a human body.  The poems were as 
sexually frank as diary entries, and the rhythms of the words took
'free verse' to a new threshold; it was as if meter and rhyme had 
never existed.  <P>

Walter Whitman (he became 'Walt' as part of his self-invention) was 
born of Quaker parentage near Huntington, Long Island.  He taught 
in various Long Island schools and worked for several newspapers,
including the <I>Brooklyn Eagle</I>.  He published some of his 
writings, but by his mid-thirties had still not displayed 
the slightest hint of his unique talent and vision.  
He published 'Leaves of Grass' himself in 1855.  He 
mailed a copy to Ralph Waldo Emerson, who immediately recognized
the book's unusual worth and wrote Whitman a letter with the famous 
line so many writers have since wished to hear : "I greet you at the 
beginning of a great career." <P>

Whitman was enormously affected by the Civil War, and published a 
series of wartime poems under the title 'Drum-Taps.'  These poems,
like many others, were eventually folded into 'Leaves of Grass,' 
which Whitman added to throughout his life, publishing nine 
different editions.  By the end of his life Whitman was a tremendous
literary celebrity.  In the 20th Century his unhinged poetic rhythms 
provided

with the only voice that could speak the words of

In Huntington, Long Island, Walt Whitman is memorialized by a huge
shopping mall where teenagers shop for shirts and mothers lug screaming
babies through the echoing halls, the immortal words of the Good Gray Poet 
on the minds of each and every one.  I did a photo essay at this mall,
which you can see as part of my latest web project,
