<I>(Now that you've entered the Allen Ginsberg zone of influence, I suggest 
you leave by linking to the recitation of Blake at the end of this page.  
I don't know why.  But this poem was often sung during Ginsberg's 
poetry readings.)</I><P>

Louis Ginsberg was a published poet, a high school teacher and a moderate 
Jewish Socialist.  His wife, Naomi, was a radical Communist and irrepressible 
nudist who went tragically insane in early adulthood.  Somewhere between the 
two in temperament was the Ginsberg's second son, Irwin Allen.  <P>

A shy and complicated child growing up in 
<A HREF="../Places/Paterson.html">Paterson</A>, 
New Jersey, Allen's home life was dominated by his mother's bizarre and
frightening episodes.  A severe paranoid, she often trusted young Allen when she
was convinced the rest of the family and the world was plotting against her.  
As the sensitive boy tried to understand what was happening around him, he also
had to struggle to comprehend what was happening inside him, because he was 
consumed by lust for other boys his age.  <P> 

He discovered the poetry of 
<A HREF="../People/WaltWhitman.html">Walt Whitman</A>
(the original Beatnik) in high school, but despite his interest in poetry
he followed his father's advice and began planning a career as a labor lawyer.
This was what he had in mind when he began his freshman year at 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>, 
but he fell in with a crowd of wild souls there, including fellow students 
<A HREF="../People/LucienCarr.html">Lucien Carr</A> and
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> 
and non-student friends 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> and
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>.  
These delinquent young philosophers were equally obsessed with drugs, 
crime, sex and literature. Ginsberg, the youngest and most innocent member 
of the circle, helped them develop their literary smarts, while they helped 
him in turn by utterly shattering his bookish naivete. <P>

His new crowd was based at Columbia, but they did not encourage him in
his studies, and he eventually got suspended from Columbia for various small
offenses.  He began consorting with Times Square junkies and thieves (mostly
friends of Burroughs), experimenting with Benzedrine and marijuana, 
and cruising gay bars in 
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">Greenwich Village</A>, 
all the time believing himself and his friends to be working towards some kind 
of uncertain great poetic vision, which he and Kerouac called the New Vision.  
He began a passionate (for him, anyway) sexual affair with the reluctant
Neal Cassady, and visited Cassady in 
<A HREF="../Places/Denver.html">Denver</A> and 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>, 
helping to set
in motion the cross-country trend that would soon inspire Kerouac's 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>' 
adventures.  The joyful craziness of his city friends somehow became a 
symbolic counterpoint, for Ginsberg, to the real craziness of his mother,
whose condition continued to worsen until she was hospitalized for life and
finally lobotomized.  Many people deal with insanity in the family by becoming
exaggeratedly normal, but Ginsberg went in the opposite direction.  Knowing 
himself to be basically sane, he embraced bizarreness as a style of life,
as if seeking to find the edge his mother had fallen over.   Reading
<A HREF="../People/WilliamBlake.html">William Blake</A> 
in a Harlem apartment one summer day in 1948, the 26-year-old Allen Ginsberg 
had a tremendous mad vision in which Blake came to him in person.  This was 
the great moment of his life, and he joyfully told his family and friends 
that he had found God.  <P>

The whole wild scene crashed, though, when the criminal activities of 
several of Ginsberg's friends (such as Burroughs and 
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke</A>)
resulted in his arrest and imprisonment.  Ginsberg entered a 'straight' phase: 
he recounced Burroughs, immersed himself in psychoanalytic treatment, and even
began dating a woman named Helen Parker.  Now a self-declared heterosexual, he
found a job as a marketing researcher.  In an office in the Empire State 
Building, he helped develop an advertising campaign for Ipana Toothpaste 
(remember the 'Brush-a brush-a brush-a!' scene in the movie version 
of 'Grease'?) <P>

This phase was not meant to last.  He met a kindred spirit, 
<A HREF="../People/CarlSolomon.html">Carl Solomon</A>,
in the waiting room of a psychiatric hospital.  He introduced himself to the 
important New Jersey poet
<A HREF="../People/WilliamCarlosWilliams.html">William Carlos Williams</A>, 
whose epic visionary poem about the town of Paterson had impressed 
Ginsberg greatly.  Bearing a letter of introduction from the poet 
Williams, Ginsberg travelled to San Francisco and met
<A HREF="../People/KennethRexroth.html">Kenneth Rexroth</A>, 
ringmaster of an emerging vibrant and youthful local poetry movement,
which Ginsberg became a part of almost instantly.  <P>

At the age of 29, Ginsberg had written much poetry but published almost
none.  He worked hard to promote the works of Kerouac and Burroughs to 
publishers, neglecting to promote his own.  Even so, he 
was the first Beat writer to gain popular notice when he delivered a 
thundering performance of his new poem 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>' 
at the now-legendary
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A> 
poetry reading in October 1955. This great poem, conveniently publicized by a 
bungled obscenity charge that made Allen a worldwide symbol of sexual depravity
(as homosexuality was then perceived), was <I>the</I> great expression of Beat 
defiance, just as Kerouac's 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>,' 
published two years later, would be the great expression of Beat yearnings. <P>

Ginsberg followed 'Howl' with several other important new poems, such as
'<A HREF="../Texts/SunflowerSutra.html">Sunflower Sutra</A>.'
Now at a critical stage in his career, he was somehow able to avoid the 
'fame burnout' that would soon engulf Kerouac.  According to Bruce Cook in 
his book 'The Beat Generation,' Ginsberg even mellowed considerably during 
this period, after travelling the world, discovering
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhism</A> and
falling in love with 
<A HREF="../People/PeterOrlovsky.html">Peter Orlovsky</A>, 
who would remain a constant 
companion (though their relationship was not monogamous) for thirty years.
Perhaps most importantly, he exorcised some internal demons by writing 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Kaddish.html">Kaddish</A>,' 
a brilliant and surprising poem about his mother's insanity and death.<P>

His celebrity continued to grow as the 'Beat' concept evolved from an 
idea into a movement and then into a cliche.  In the early sixties, Ginsberg
threw himself into the hippie scene.  He and Timothy Leary worked together
to publicize Leary's new discovery, the psychedelic drug LSD, and Ginsberg 
attempted to turn on every famous cultural figure in his address book, 
including Willem De Kooning, Franz Kline, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonius Monk, 
Robert Lowell and Jack Kerouac (whose cranky response sent Timothy Leary 
on his first bum trip).  <P>

As a famous American poet, Ginsberg was able to attain audiences with important
political figures all over the world, and during the 60's he took advantage
of this repeatedly.  He pissed off one important official after another, 
causing furors in India, getting kicked out of Cuba and Prague, and 
annoying America's right wing to no end.  He was a familiar bushy-bearded 
figure at protests against the Vietnam War, and his willingness to state his 
controversial views in public was an important factor in the development 
of the revolutionary state of mind that America developed during the 1960's. <P>

The list of 60's events that Ginsberg played an important part in is almost
unbelievably huge.  He participated in
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey</A>'s 
Acid Test Festivals in San Francisco, and helped Kesey break the ice between
the San Francisco hippies and the antagonistic Hell's Angels.
In the summer of 1965 Ginsberg made a seminal trip to 
London 
with several other Beat figures.  Their reading at the Royal Albert Hall 
signalled the beginning of the London underground scene, based at the 
UFO Club, from which bands like 
<A HREF="http://k2.princeton.edu/floyd">Pink Floyd</A> and
The Soft Machine 
would emerge. 
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/employees/howells/dylan.html">Bob Dylan</A>
often cited Ginsberg as one of the few literary figures he could stand. 
Ginsberg can be seen standing in the alley in the background of Dylan's 1965 
'Subterranean Homesick Blues' video, and would later play a major part 
in Dylan's 1977 film 
'<A HREF="../Films/RenaldoAndClara.html">Renaldo and Clara</A>.'  
Ginsberg,
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A> and
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A>
led the crowd in chanting 'OM' at the San Fransisco Be-In in 1967.  Ginsberg,
Burroughs, Jean Genet and 
<A HREF="../People/TerrySouthern.html">Terry Southern</A>
were key figures at the Chicago 
Democratic Convention antiwar protests in 1968.  One of the
only radical events of the Sixties that Ginsberg was <I>not</I> a part of was
the Stonewall gay uprising, and Ginsberg showed up at the site the next day to 
offer his support.  <P>

In 1970 Ginsberg met the controversial Tibetan guru Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.  
Ginsberg would soon accept Trungpa as his personal guru.  He and poet
<A HREF="../People/AnneWaldman.html">Anne Waldman</A>
joined to create a poetry school, 
the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics,
at Trungpa's 
<A HREF="../Places/Naropa.html">Naropa Institute</A>
in Boulder, Colorado. <P>

In the early eighties, Ginsberg even joined the punk rock movement, appearing
on the Clash's 'Combat Rock' album and performing with them on stage. <P> 

Ginsberg carried on an active social schedule until his 
<A HREF="../GinsbergTribute.html">death in April 1997</A>.  He never moved
away from his humble apartment in the poetry-rich streets of New York City's 
Lower East Side, and would constantly be seen at local readings and 
multicultural gatherings, either on a stage or in a crowd.  He was one
of my favorite living writers, and yet I personally grew so accustomed to 
seeing him sitting a few benches from me at readings that I stopped noticing.
Now that he's dead these moments take on a broader dimension in my memory.<P>

I spoke to him at length only once; you can read about it
<A HREF="../Topics/HowIMetGinsberg.html">here</A>.<P>

I also saw him read poetry countless times, but it never stopped being a unique
experience.  He was a truly and simply free soul on stage, clinking little finger 
cymbals and barking weirdly melodic chants with an impish smile behind his 
graying beard and thick glasses.  I particularly remember seeing him at a 
Carnegie Hall benefit for Tibet House, where performers like Paul Simon and 
Philip Glass received polite applause from the 
well-dressed crowd.  Ginsberg wandered out 
looking like a bearded <I>shtetl</I> shoemaker and began croaking a weird 
and hilarious rant about meditation.  The crowd loosened up for the first 
time, laughing at his Zen jokes, and they finally gave him the biggest applause 
of the night.<P>

(One good way to experience this poet's utter weirdness today is to listen to
his music.  Songs like "Birdbrain"  and "Gospel Noble Truths" are two
of the more bizarrely rewarding.  But don't play this stuff at a party
unless you want everybody to go home.)<P>

The first great thing about Ginsberg was his refusal to be embarrassed or to deny
himself.  And the other great thing was his poetry, which spoke in so strong a 
voice that his talent could not be denied.<P><P>
