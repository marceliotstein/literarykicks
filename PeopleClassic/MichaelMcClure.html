Born: October 20, 1932 <BR>
Place of Birth: Marysville, Kansas <P>

McClure grew up in Seattle, where he was fascinated by nature and wildlife and
expected to grow up to be a natural scientist.  He went to 
<A HREF="../People/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>
as a young man, participated in a poetry workshop with Robert Duncan,
and got drawn into the emerging Beat vortex of the San Francisco
Poetry Renaissance.<P>
  
He was one of the five poets who read at the famous
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A>
reading in 1955.  I've typed in of the poems he read there, a poem I like
a lot called 
<A HREF="../Texts/PointLobos.html">'Point Lobos: Animism'</A>.
McClure's first book, 'Passage,' was published in 1956.  Like 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>
he writes poetry infused with the awareness of nature, but McClure's
special interest is in the animal consciousness that too often lies dormant
in mankind.  He has a consistent message: "When a man does not admit that 
he is an animal, he is less than an animal.  Not more but less."<P>

There is no cuteness in McClure's animal kingdom, populated with Buddhist
panda bears, Beat tomcats and doomed whales.  I have only recently begun to 
read his work, but he's quickly becoming one of my favorites. A
short passage from his 1970 book 'The Mad Cub' (I found it in 'The Beat 
Reader') is 
<A HREF="../Texts/MadCubCat.html">here</A>. <P> 

McClure appears as the handsome and happily-married Pat McLear in 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac</A>'s 
novel
'<A HREF="../Books/BigSurBook.html">Big Sur</A>,'
in which Kerouac raves about McClure's poem 'Dark Brown.' <P>

McClure hung around Haight-Ashbury during the Summer of Love, playing poetic 
melodies on his autoharp and participating with Ginsberg and Snyder at the 
January 1967 Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park.  During this period, he wrote 
the original words on which Janis Joplin's song 
"Oh Lord, Won't You Buy Me a Mercedes Benz" was based.  <P>

He remains very active as a poet, essayist and playwright.  His plays
(such as 'The Beard' and 'Josephine: The Mouse Singer') have been especially 
successful in recent decades.  In the early 90's he began performing live poetry
set to music by Ray Manzarek, the 
distinctive keyboardist from the Doors.  A video of one of these performances, 
"Love Lion," is available at
<A HREF="http://www.mysticfire.com">Mystic Fire Video</A> and other
places. <P>
