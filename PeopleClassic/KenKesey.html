<H1>Ken Kesey</H1>

Born: Sept 17, 1935 <BR>
Place of Birth: La Junta, Colorado<P>

As a cultural and literary figure, Ken Kesey stands exactly at the midpoint 
between the Beats of the 50's and the Hippies of the 60's.  Kesey borrowed from 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
quite consciously -- in fact, he went on the road with 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>, 
and if that's not borrowing from Kerouac I don't know what is.  But there
were several differences to Kesey's 60's version of the Great Trip Across
America: <P>
<UL>
<LI>They drove a psychedelic bus named Furthur instead of a big old Hudson or
a borrowed Cadillac
<LI>They preferred LSD to liquor
<LI>They treated women as equals instead of sex objects (most of the time)
<LI>They danced to The Warlocks (soon to become the
<A HREF="http://www.dead.net">Grateful Dead</A>)
instead of grooving on 
<A HREF="../Topics/Jazz.html">jazz</A> 
and shouting 'GO!'
</UL>

Kesey did not write about this scene, but journalist Tom Wolfe did in 
'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'. 
Kesey did write two important novels, the powerful 
'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' 
in which a modern psychiatric ward becomes a metaphor for oppressive 
American society,
and 'Sometimes A Great Notion.'  Interestingly, these books are not the 
least bit trippy, though their intentions are without a doubt cosmic. <P>

He later published 'The Further Inquiry,' a screenplay with many photos from 
the bus trip and a mostly incomprehensible plot in which Kesey, Cassady and 
others must testify at some sort of supernatural trial.  Kesey also recently 
published 'Sailor Song,' a wacky allegory involving environmental crises, a 
Kesey-like middle-aged writer, and a rock band called the Dreadful Great. <P>

Ken Kesey books, memorabilia and other interesting doo-dads are

Todd Brendan Fahey has some interesting things to say about Kesey and
the government's role in Kesey's acid test scene in his book
