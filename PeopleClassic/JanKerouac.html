<H1>Jan Kerouac</H1>

Born: February 16, 1952<BR>
Place of Birth: Albany, New York<BR>
Died: June 7, 1996<BR>
Place of Death: Albuquerque, New Mexico<P>

Janet Michelle Kerouac is universally recognized as 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>'s 
daughter, but when she was born to his second wife,
<A HREF="../People/JoanHaverty.html">Joan Haverty Kerouac</A>,
he refused to accept this fact.
His marriage to Joan was already over by this time, and Jan saw
her father very few times.  The sad story of their last meeting 
was told by Jan in her own first book, "Baby Driver," which takes
its title from a Paul Simon song.<P>

Jan also wrote a second book, "Train Song."  I haven't read either 
yet, but I've heard good things about "Baby Driver" from a number of
people and plan to read it soon.  Towards the end of her life Jan,
her body broken by kidney disease and years of rough living, became
involved in an ugly and bitter battle with the family of 
<A HREF="../People/StellaSampas.html">Stella Sampas</A>,
Kerouac's third and last wife, over the disposition and
control of Jack's estate.  She died in the midst of this
battle, leaving her third novel, "Parrot Fever," unpublished.<P>

(NOTE: As of this writing, in the summer of 1997, the battle over
the Kerouac estate still rages.  I have many times found myself
being dragged against my will into the general direction of this battle, 
usually by somebody heavily involved in one side or the other.  I
have each time remained happy by managing, sometimes just barely, 
to steer clear of it.  However, at one point in 1995 a friend of Literary
Kicks named Ralph Virgo persuaded me to let him publish an
open-minded series of articles on this battle in these pages.  
The project never
fully got off the ground, but the remains of

are still online.)<P>
