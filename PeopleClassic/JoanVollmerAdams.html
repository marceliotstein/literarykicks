<H1>Joan Vollmer Adams</H1>

Joan's story is one of the sadder ones in the annals of the Beats.  As
a bright and vivacious 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia</A>
student in the early 1940's, she was considered by some to be even smarter
than her odd older boyfriend, 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>.
She lived in an off-campus apartment with 
<A HREF="../People/EdieParker.html">Edie Parker</A>
(later, briefly, the wife of 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>)
that became a second home to Kerouac, Burroughs, 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
and others in their crowd.  But when they all began taking
Benzedrines for kicks Joan became tragically attracted to the uppers,
and degenerated into a state of addiction that saddened and
disappointed her friends.<P>

Joan Vollmer (who had became Joan Vollmer Adams after a brief marriage) 
carried on a sexual relationship with Burroughs, despite the fact that
he was overwhelmingly gay.  They had a son together, 
William S. Burroughs Jr., 
who went on to write two books before dying in his thirties.  Joan also
had a daughter from her first marriage. <P>
 
After the Columbia crowd dispersed, Burroughs left New York to become a
farmer in Texas and New Orleans, and sent for Joan to join him.  The 
change of scenery did not cure her addiction to bennies.  The rather pathetic 
figure she had become is searingly depicted in the 
New Orleans 
scenes in Kerouac's
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>.'  
She and Burroughs lived together for many years in the South, occasionally 
travelling to 
<A HREF="../Places/Mexico.html">Mexico</A>.  Burroughs loved guns, and one day 
in Mexico he tried to show off his marksmanship to a group of friends by asking 
Joan to place a glass on her head for him to shoot off.  She did as he asked 
and he shot her in the head, killing her instantly. <P>  

The circumstances of this death form the central motif in David 
Cronenberg's film inspired by 'Naked Lunch.'
Joan is played by Judy Davis, who is excellent in the role (as she 
is in almost every role she plays).  <P>
