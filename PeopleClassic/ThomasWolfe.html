Thomas Wolfe was an enormously popular novelist during the middle of this
century.  His highly literary and sentimental style has dated him somewhat,
and he is not as often read now as he was during his own time.  His 
intensely introspective works were highly valued by the generation that 
came of age in middle decades of the century, and it was Thomas Wolfe's books 
that inspired the young

to become an author.  Kerouac's emulation of Wolfe's style is especially
obvious in Kerouac's first novel,

Wolfe attended the University of North Carolina and then Harvard, where he
studied playwriting.  His first plays, like his novels, were about the 
life and people he knew in North Carolina.  In 1929 he wrote the famous
novel 'Look Homeward, Angel,' in which Eugene Gant of Altamont stands in 
for Thomas Wolfe of Asheville.  Wolfe continued Eugene Gant's story in 
'Of Time And The River' (1935), and invented a new alter ego, George 
Webber, for a later novel, 'You Can't Go Home Again,' which was published
posthumously after Wolfe contracted tuberculosis and died suddenly during 
surgery. <P>
