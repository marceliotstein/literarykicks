Kenneth Rexroth was not a Beat poet.  He led his own earlier cultural movement 
in 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>, 
inventing the idea of the Northern California city as a culturally 
'happening' place.  Before 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
arrived at Rexroth's doorstep in 1953 with a letter of introduction from
<A HREF="../People/WilliamCarlosWilliams.html">William Carlos Williams</A>, 
Rexroth had already gathered together several young 
poets who would soon participate in the Bay Area Beat scene, particularly 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>,
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A> and
<A HREF="../People/PhilipWhalen.html">Philip Whalen</A>. <P>
In this role as the master of the city's poets, he presided over the 
introduction of the 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A>
to the world
in the mid-to-late fifties, risking his name and reputation on the 
unconventional young upstarts, and organizing the 
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A>
poetry reading that caused a literary sensation in 1955.<P>

According to some biographical material, Rexroth later grew slightly irritated 
as the Beats began to reach immense fame, often offending his sensitive
poetic ideals with their crazy hijinks.  But this is typical old-guard vs. 
new-guard stuff.  Rexroth was an important poet in his own scene, and deserves 
our eternal appreciation for having invented the idea of San Francisco as a 
center of literary innovation. <P>

Michael Blackstone has created a 
<A HREF="http://users.aol.com/mikeb1/rexroth/classics.html">page about Rexroth.</A>  
This includes Rexroth's list of classic literature which,
interestingly, includes no Beat writers, though the last writer on the list
is William Carlos Williams.<P>
