I'm typing this poem in on October 7, 1995, the 40th anniversary of the 
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A>
poetry reading at which it was first read.  Several great poems were introduced to
the world on that day, but I chose to type in this particular poem because
it somehow connects for me to my own experience as the creator of Literary
Kicks.  I'm sitting now in front of a Sun SPARCstation 4 in a room that couldn't
be farther from Point Lobos in Northern California, and yet the poem 
describes something I've been wanting to say. <P>

In the year and three months since I introduced Literary Kicks on the
Web, I've gotten literally thousands of e-mails from strangers, sometimes
20 or 30 a day on busy days.  Some of these strangers have become good
friends, but all of their words have meant a lot to me.  My little $17.50 a 
month account at Netcom has indeed been "a spot so full of spirits," and 
that's what really keeps me going with this project.  It's nice to be 
mentioned in books and magazines, but it's the personal touch that matters the 
most.  So I'm typing this poem in right now in honor of everybody who's 
liked my site enough to let me know.<P>

<H1>Point Lobos: Animism</H1>

It is possible my friend<BR>
If I have had a fat belly<BR>
That the wolf lives on fat<BR>
Gnawing slowly<BR>
Through a visceral night of rancor.<BR>
It is possible that the absense of pain<BR>
May be so great<BR>
That the possibility of care<BR>
May be impossible.<P>

Perhaps to know pain.<BR>
Anxiety, rather than the fear<BR>
Of the fear of anxiety.<BR>
This talk of miracles!<P>

Of Animism:<BR>
I have been in a spot so full of spirits<BR>
That even the most joyful animist<BR>
Brooded<BR>
When all in sight was less to be cared about<BR>
Than death<BR>
And there was no noise in the ears<BR>
That mattered.<BR>
(I knelt in the shade<BR>
By a cold salt pool<BR>
And felt the entrance of hate<BR>
On many legs,<BR>
The soul like a clambering<BR>
Water vascular system.<P>

No scuttling could matter<BR>
Yet I formed in my mind<BR>
The most beautiful<BR>
Of maxims.<BR>
How could I care<BR>
For your illness or mine?)<BR>
This talk of bodies!<P>

It is impossible to speak<BR>
Of lupine or tulips<BR>
When one may read<BR>
His name<BR>
Spelled by the mold on the stumps<BR>
When the forest moves about one.<BR>
Heel. Nostril.<BR>
Light. Light! Light!<BR>
This is the bird's song<BR>
You may tell it<BR>
to your children.<P>
