<I>This is the complete text of the article by John Clellon Holmes
that ran in the
</I>New York Times Magazine<I>
on November 16, 1952.  This article introduced the phrase 'beat
generation' to the world, although the writers who would come to 
personify this generation would not be published for several years more.  For

My commentary : 
There are some interesting points in this article, but I can't help feeling 
annoyed at the idea of categorizing an entire generation.  I don't believe 
</I>any<I>
true statement can be made about a million or more people, except
statements that are so general they are true for all times.  So, for the 
hipster and the Young Republican here, substitute the hippie and the 
straight of twenty years ago, or the slacker and the yuppie today.  Newspapers
and magazines love to get excited about how 'different' each new generation is, 
but each new generation is just going through the same crisis the one before
it went through.  It's called 'growing up.'  <P>

In saying this, I don't mean to 'flame' John Clellon Holmes, a good writer 
who recognized the inanity of labelling a generation and even alluded to 
it in this article.  Furthermore, I'm sure the idea of defining a generation 
was nowhere near as played out in the early 50's as it is now.</I> </P>

<H3>This Is The Beat Generation</H3>

by John Clellon Holmes <BR>
The New York Times Magazine, November 16, 1952<P>

Several months ago, a national magazine ran a story under the heading 
'Youth' and the subhead 'Mother Is Bugged At Me.'  It concerned an 
eighteen-year-old California girl who had been picked up for smoking
marijuana and wanted to talk about it.  While a reporter took down her
ideas in the uptempo language of 'tea,' someone snapped a picture.  In 
view of her contention that she was part of a whole new culture where
one out of every five people you meet is a user, it was an arresting
photograph.  In the pale, attentive face, with its soft eyes and 
intelligent mouth, there was no hint of corruption.  It was a face which
could only be deemed criminal through an enormous effort of reighteousness.
Its only complaint seemed to be: 'Why don't people leave us alone?'  It was 
the face of a beat generation. <P>

That clean young face has been making the newspapers steadily since the war.
Standing before a judge in a Bronx courthouse, being arraigned for stealing
a car, it looked up into the camera with curious laughter and no guilt.  The 
same face, with a more serious bent, stared from the pages of <I>Life</I> 
magazine, representing a graduating class of ex-GI's, and said that as it
believed small business to be dead, it intended to become a comfortable cog
in the largest corporation it could find.  A little younger, a little more
bewildered, it was this same face that the photographers caught in Illinois
when the first non-virgin club was uncovered.  The young copywriter, leaning 
down the bar on Third Avenue, quietly drinking himself into relaxation, and the
energetic hotrod driver of Los Angeles, who plays Russian Roulette with a 
jalopy, are separated only by a continent and a few years.  They are the 
extremes.  In between them fall the secretaries wondering whether to sleep
with their boyfriends now or wait; the mechanic berring up with the guys and
driving off to Detroit on a whim; the models studiously name-dropping at a 
cocktail party.  But the face is the same.  Bright, level, realistic, 
challenging. <P>

Any attempt to label an entire generation is unrewarding, and yet the 
generation which went through the last war, or at least could get a 
drink easily once it was over, seems to possess a uniform, general quality
which demands an adjective ... The origins of the word 'beat' are obscure, 
but the meaning is only too clear to most Americans.  More than mere weariness,
it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw.  It involves a 
sort of nakedness of mind, and, ultimately, of soul; a feeling of being 
reduced to the bedrock of consciousness.  In short, it means being 
undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself.  A man is beat whenever
he goes for broke and wagers the sum of his resources on a single number; and 
the young generation has done that continually from early youth. <P>

Its members have an instinctive individuality, needing no bohemianism or 
imposed eccentricity to express it.  Brought up during the collective bad
circumstances of a dreary depression, weaned during the collective uprooting
of a global war, they distrust collectivity.  But they have never been able
to keep the world out of their dreams.  The fancies of their childhood 
inhabited the half-light of Munich, the Nazi-Soviet pact, and the eventual 
blackout.  Their adolescence was spent in a topsy-turvy world of war bonds,
swing shifts, and troop movements.  They grew to independent mind on 
beachheads, in gin mills and USO's, in past-midnight arrivals and pre-dawn
departures.  Their brothers, husbands, fathers or boy friends turned up dead
one day at the other end of a telegram.  At the four trembling corners of the
world, or in the home town invaded by factories or lonely servicemen, they 
had intimate experience with the nadir and the zenith of human conduct, and 
little time for much that came between.  The peace they inherited was only as 
secure as the next headline.  It was a cold peace.  Their own lust for freedon,
and the ability to live at a pace that kills (to which the war had adjusted 
them), led to black markets, bebop, narcotics, sexual promiscuity, hucksterism,
and Jean-Paul Sartre.  The beatness set in later. <P>

It is a postwar generation, and, in a world which seems to mark its cycles 
by its wars, it is already being compared to that other postwar generation, 
which dubbed itself 'lost'.  The Roaring Twenties, and the generation that
made them roar, are going through a sentimental revival, and the comparison 
is valuable.  The Lost Generation was discovered in a roadster, laughing 
hysterically because nothing meant anything anymore.  It migrated to Europe, 
unsure whether it was looking for the 'orgiastic future' or escaping from the
'puritanical past.'  Its symbols were the flapper, the flask of bootleg 
whiskey, and an attitude of desparate frivolity best expressed by the line:
'Tennis, anyone?'  It was caught up in the romance of disillusionment, until
even that became an illusion.  Every act in its drama of lostness was a tragic 
or ironic third act, and T.S. Eliot's <I>The Waste Land</I> was more than the 
dead-end statement of a perceptive poet.  The pervading atmosphere of that poem was an almost objectless sense of loss, through which the reader felt 
immediately that the cohesion of things had disappeared.  It was, for an entire
generation, an image which expressed, with dreadful accuracy, its own spiritual
condition. <P>

But the wild boys of today are not lost.  Their flushed, often scoffing, 
always intent faces elude the word, and it would sound phony to them.  For 
this generation lacks that eloquent air of bereavement which made so many of
the exploits of the Lost Generation symbolic actions.  Furthermore, the repeatedinventory of shattered ideals, and the laments about the mud in moral currents,
which so obsessed the Lost Generation, do not concern young people today.  They
take these things frighteningly for granted.  They were brought up in these 
ruins and no longer notice them.  They drink to 'come down' or to 'get high,' 
not to illustrate anything.  Their excursions into drugs or promiscuity come
out of curiousity, not disillusionment. <P>

Only the most bitter among them would call their reality a nightmare and 
protest that they have indeed lost something, the future.  For ever since they 
were old enough to imagine one, that has been in jeapordy anyway.  The absence
of personal and social values is to them, not a revelation shaking the ground 
beneath them, but a problem demanding a day-to-day solution.  <I>How</I> to 
live seems to them much more crucial than <I>why</I>.  And it is precisely at
this point that the copywriter and the hotrod driver meet and their identical
beatness becomes significant, for, unlike the Lost Generation, which was 
occupied with the loss of faith, the Beat Generation is becoming more and more
occupied with the need for it.  As such, it is a disturbing illustration of 
Voltaire's reliable old joke: 'If there were no God, it would be necessary to
invent him.'  Not content to bemoan his absence, they are busily and 
haphazardly inventing totems for him on all sides.  <P>

For the giggling nihilist, eating up the highway at ninety miles an hour and 
steering with his feet, is no Harry Crosby, the poet of the Lost Generation who
planned to fly his plane into the sun one day because he could no longer accept
the modern world.  On the contrary, the hotrod driver invites death only to 
outwit it.  He is affirming the life within him in the only way he knows how, 
at the extreme.  The eager-faced girl, picked up on a dope charge, is not one of
those 'women and girls carried screaming with drink or drugs from public 
places,' of whom Fitzgerald wrote.  Instead, with persuasive seriousness, she 
describes the sense of community she has found in marijuana, which society 
never gave her.  The copywriter, just as drunk by midnight as his Lost 
Generation counterpart, probably reads <I>God and Man at Yale</I> during his 
Sunday afternoon hangover.  The difference is this almost exaggerated will to 
believe in something, if only in themselves.  It is a <I>will</I> to believe, 
even in the face of an inability to do so in conventional terms.  And that is 
bound to lead to excesses in one direction or another. <P>

The shock that older people feel at the sight of this Beat Generation is, at
its deepest level, not so much repugnance at the facts, as it is distress at
the attitudes which move it.  Though worried by this distress, they most often
argue or legislate in terms of the facts rather than the attitudes.  The 
newspaper reader, studying the eyes of young dope addicts, can only find an 
outlet for his horror and bewilderment in demands that passers be given the
electric chair.  Sociologists, with a more academic concern, are just as 
troubled by the legions of young men whose topmost ambition seems to be to 
find a secure birth in a monolithic corporation.  Contemporary historians 
express mild surprise at the lack of organized movements, political, religous,
or otherwise, among the young.  The articles they write remind us that being 
one's own boss and being a natural joiner are two of our most cherished 
national traits.  Everywhere people with tidy moralities shake their heads and
wonder what is happening to the younger generation.<P>

Perhaps they have not noticed that, behind the excess on the one hand, and the 
conformity on the other, lies that wait-and-see detachment that results from 
having to fall back for support more on one's capacity for human endurance than
on one's philosophy of life.  Not that the Beat Generation is immune to ideas; 
they fascinate it.  Its wars, both past and future, were and will be wars of 
ideas.  It knows, however, that in the final, private moment of conflict a man
is really fighting another man, and not an idea.  And that the same goes for
love.  So it is a generation with a greater facility for entertaining ideas 
than for believing in them.  But it is also the first generation in several
centuries for which the act of faith has been an obsessive problem, quite
aside from the reasons for having a particular faith or not having it.  It
exhibits on every side, and in a bewildering number of facets, a perfect 
craving to believe.  <P>

Though it is certainly a generation of extremes, including both the hipster
and the radical young Republican in its ranks, it renders unto Caesar (i.e,
society) what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's.  For the wildest hipster,
making a mystique of bop, drugs and the night life, there is no desire to 
shatter the 'square' society in which he lives, only to elude it.  To get on
a soapbox or write a manifesto would seem to him absurd.  Looking at the 
normal world, where most everything is a 'drag' for him, he nevertheless says:
'Well, that's the Forest of Arden after all.  And even <I>it</I> jumps if you
look at it right.'  Equally, the young Republican, though often seeming to 
hold up Babbitt as his culture hero, is neither vulgar nor materialistic, as
Babbitt was.  He conforms because he believes it is socially practical, not
necessarily virtuous.  Both positions, however, are the result of more or
less the same conviction -- namely that the valueless abyss of modern life
is unbearable.<P>

<P>

For beneath the excess and the conformity, there is something other than 
detachment.  There are the stirrings of a quest.  What the hipster is 
looking for in his 'coolness' (withdrawal) or 'flipness' (ecstasy) is,
after all, a feeling on somewhereness, not just another diversion.  The 
young Republican feels that there is a point beyond which change becomes 
chaos, and what he wants is not simply privelege or wealth, but a stable
position from which to operate.  Both have had enough of homelessness, 
valuelessness, faithlessnes. <P>

The variety and the extremity of their solutions are only a final indication
that for today's young people there is not as yet a single external pivot around
which they can, as a generation, group their observations and their aspirations.
There is no single philosophy, no single party, no single attitude.  The failure
of most orthodox moral and social concepts to reflect fully the life they have
known is probably the reason for this, but because of it each person becomes a 
walking, self-contained unit, compelled to meet, or at least endure, the problem
of being young in a seemingly helpless world in his own way. <P>

More than anything else, this is what is responsible for this generation's 
reluctance to name itself, its reluctance to discuss itself as a group, 
sometimes its reluctance to be itself.  For invented gods invariably
disappoint those who worship them.  Only the need for them goes on, and it
is this need, exhausting one object after another, which projects the Beat 
Generation forward into the future and will one day deprive it of its 
beatness.<P>

Dostoyevski wrote in the early 1880's that 'Young Russia is talking of 
nothing but the eternal questions now.'  With appropriate changes, 
something very like this is beginning to happen in America, in an American
way; a re-evaluation of which the exploits and attitudes of this generation
are only symptoms.  No single comparison of one generation against another can
accurately measure effects, but it seems obvious that a lost generation, 
occupied with disillusionment and trying to keep busy among the broken stones, 
is poetically moving, but not very dangerous.  But a beat generation, driven by
a desparate craving for belief and as yet unable to accept the moderations 
which are offered it, is quite another matter.  Thirty years later, after all,
the generation of which Dostoyevski wrote was meeting in cellars and making 
bombs. <P>

This generation may make no bombs; it will probably be asked to drop some, and
have some dropped on it, however, and this fact is never far from its mind.  It
is one of the pressures which created it and will play a large part in what will
happen to it.  There are those who believe that in generations such as this 
there is always the constant possibility of a great new moral idea, conceived in
desparation, coming to life.  Others note the self-indulgence, the waste, the 
apparent social irresponsibility, and disagree. <P>

But its ability to keep its eyes open, and yet avoid cynicism; its 
ever-increasing conviction that the problem of modern life is essentially
a spiritual problem; and that capacity for sudden wisdom which people who
live hard and go far possess, are assets and bear watching.  And, anyway, the
clear, challenging faces are worth it. <P>
