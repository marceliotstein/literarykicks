	This bent metal serpent/ holy horn with lids like beer<BR>
	   mug/ with phallic tail  why did they invent you<BR>
	   before Coleman Hawkins  was  born   ?<BR>
	This curved shiney tune gut/ hanging lynched like/ J<BR>
	   shaped intitial of jazz/ wordless without a reed  when<BR>
	  Coleman Hawkins first fondled it/kissed it with Black<BR>
	 sound  did COngo blood sucking Belges frown  ?<BR>
    This tenor/alto/bass/baritone/soprano/moan/cry &<BR>
	   shout-a-phone !   sex-oh-phone/tell-it-like-damn-<BR>
	  sho-isa-phone  !What tremors ran through Adolphe<BR>
	  Saxe the day Bean grabbed his   ax ?<BR>
    This golden mine of a million marvelous sounds/black<BR>
	   notes with myriad shadows/or empty crooked tube of<BR>
	  technical white poor-formance/calculated keys that<BR>
	 never unlock soul doors/white man made machine saved<BR>
	from zero   by Coleman Hawkins  !<BR>
  This saxophone salvation/modern gri gri  hanging from<BR>
	   jazzmen's necks  placed there  by Coleman Hawkins<BR>
	 a full body & soul sorcerer whose spirit dwells eternally<BR>
	in every saxophone NOW  and  all  those  sound-a-phones<BR>
     to be<P>
