suggestion that he 
write his first Sutra.  In 1960, when he presented it to his 
publisher, he said, "While I was writing this, I thought I knew

The Scripture of the Golden Eternity <BR>
by Jack Kerouac<P>

1<BR>
Did I create that sky? Yes, for, if it was anything other than a 
conception in my mind I wouldnt have said "Sky"-That is why I am 
the golden eternity.  There are not two of us here, reader and 
writer, but one, one golden eternity, One-Which-It-Is, That-Which-
Everything-Is.<P>

2<BR>
The awakened Buddha to show the way, the chosen Messiah to die in 
the degradation of sentience, is the golden eternity.  One that is 
what is, the golden eternity, or, God, or, Tathagata-the name.  
The Named One.  The human God.  Sentient Godhood.  Animate Divine.  
The Deified One.  The Verified One.  The Free One.  The Liberator.  
The Still One.  The settled One.  The Established One.  Golden 
Eternity.  All is Well.  The Empty One.  The Ready One.  The 
Quitter.  The Sitter.  The Justified One.  The Happy One.<P>

3<BR>
That sky, if it was anything other than an illusion of my mortal 
mind I wouldnt have said "that sky." Thus I made that sky, I am 
the golden eternity.  I am Mortal Golden Eternity.<P>

4<BR>
I was awakened to show the way, chosen to die in the degradation 
of life, because I am Mortal Golden Eternity.<P>

5<BR>
I am the golden eternity in mortal animate form.<P>

6<BR>
Strictly speaking, there is no me, because all is emptiness.  I am 
empty,  I am non-existent.  All is bliss.<P>

7<BR>
This truth law has no more reality than the world.<P>

8<BR>
You are the golden eternity because there is no me and no you, 
only one golden eternity.<P>

9<BR>
The Realizer.  Entertain no imaginations whatever, for the thing 
is a no-thing.  Knowing this then is Human Godhood.<P>

10<BR>
This world is the movie of what everything is, it is one movie, 
made of the same stuff throughout, belonging to nobody, which is 
what everything is.<P>

11<BR>
If we were not all the golden eternity we wouldnt be here.  
Because we are here we cant help being pure.  To tell man to be 
pure on account of the punishing angel that punishes the bad and 
the rewarding angel that rewards the good would be like telling 
the water "Be Wet"-Never the less, all things depend on supreme 
reality, which is already established as the record of Karma 
earned-fate.<P>

12<BR>
God is not outside us but is just us, the living and the dead, the 
never-lived and never-died.  That we should learn it only now, is 
supreme reality, it was written a long time ago in the archives of 
universal mind, it is already done, there's no more to do.<P>

13<BR>
This is the knowledge that sees the golden eternity in all things, 
which is us, you, me, and which is no longer us, you, me.<P>

14<BR>
What name shall we give it which hath no name, the common eternal 
matter of the mind? If we were to call it essence, some might 
think it meant perfume, or gold, or honey.  It is not even mind.  
It is not even discussible, groupable into words; it is not even 
endless, in fact it is not even mysterious or inscrutably 
inexplicable; it is what is; it is that; it is this.  We could 
easily call the golden eternity "This." But "what's in a name?" 
asked Shakespeare.  The golden eternity by another name would be 
as sweet.  A Tathagata, a God, a Buddha by another name, an Allah, 
a Sri Krishna, a Coyote, a Brahma, a Mazda, a Messiah, an Amida, 
an Aremedeia, a Maitreya, a Palalakonuh, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 would be 
as sweet.  The golden eternity is X, the golden eternity is A, the 
golden eternity is /\, the golden eternity is O, the golden 
eternity is [ ], the golden eternity is t-h-e-g-o-l-d-e-n-e-t-e-r-
n-i-t-y.  In the beginning was the word; before the beginning, in 
the beginningless infinite neverendingness, was the essence.  Both 
the word "god" and the essence of the word, are emptiness.  The 
form of emptiness which is emptiness having taken the form of 
form, is what you see and hear and feel right now, and what you 
taste and smell and think as you read this.  Wait awhile, close 
your eyes, let your breathing stop three seconds or so, listen to 
the inside silence in the womb of the world, let your hands and 
nerve-ends drop, re-recognize the bliss you forgot, the emptiness 
and essence and ecstasy of ever having been and ever to be the 
golden eternity.  This is the lesson you forgot.<P>

15<BR>
The lesson was taught long ago in the other world systems that 
have naturally changed into the empty and awake, and are here now 
smiling in our smile and scowling in our scowl.  It is only like 
the golden eternity pretending to be smiling and scowling to 
itself; like a ripple on the smooth ocean of knowing.  The fate of 
humanity is to vanish into the golden eternity, return pouring 
into its hands which are not hands.  The navel shall receive, 
invert, and take back what'd issued forth; the ring of flesh shall 
close; the personalities of long dead heroes are blank dirt.<P>

16<BR>
The point is we're waiting, not how comfortable we are while 
waiting.  Paleolithic man waited by caves for the realization of 
why he was there, and hunted; modern men wait in beautified homes 
and try to forget death and birth.  We're waiting for the 
realization that this is the golden eternity.<P>

17<BR>
It came on time.<P>

18<BR>
There is a blessedness surely to be believed, and that is that 
everything abides in eternal ecstasy, now and forever.<P>

19<BR>
Mother Kali eats herself back.  All things but come to go.  All 
these holy forms, unmanifest, not even forms, truebodies of blank 
bright ecstasy, abiding in a trance, "in emptiness and silence' as 
it is pointed out in the Diamond-cutter, asked to be only what 
they are: GLAD.<P>

20<BR>
The secret God-grin in the trees and in the teapot, in ashes and 
fronds, fire and brick, flesh and mental human hope.  All things, 
far from yearning to be re-united with God, had never left 
themselves and here they are, Dharmakaya, the body of the truth 
law, the universal Thisness.<P>

21<BR>
"Beyond the reach of change and fear, beyond all praise and 
blame," the Lankavatara Scripture knows to say, is he who is what 
he is in time and time-less-ness, in ego and in ego-less-ness, in 
self and in self-less-ness.<P>

22<BR>
Stare deep into the world before you as if it were the void: 
innumerable holy ghosts, buddhies, and savior gods there hide, 
smiling.  All the atoms emitting light inside wavehood, there is 
no personal separation of any of it.  A hummingbird can come into 
a house and a hawk will not: so rest and be assured.  While 
looking for the light, you may suddenly be devoured by the 
darkness and find the true light.<P>

23<BR>
Things dont tire of going and coming.  The flies end up with the 
delicate viands.<P>

24<BR>
The cause of the world's woe is birth, The cure of the world's woe 
is a bent stick.<P>

25<BR>
Though it is everything, strictly speaking there is no golden 
eternity because everything is nothing: there are no things and no 
goings and comings: for all is emptiness, and emptiness is these 
forms, emptiness is this one formhood.<P>

26<BR>
All these selfnesses have already vanished.  Einstein measured 
that this present universe is an expanding bubble, and you know 
what that means.<P>

27<BR>
Discard such definite imaginations of phenomena as your own self, 
thou human being, thou'rt a numberless mass of sun-motes: each 
mote a shrine.  The same as to your shyness of other selves, 
selfness as divided into infinite numbers of beings, or selfness 
as identified as one self existing eternally.  Be obliging and 
noble, be generous with your time and help and possessions, and be 
kind, because the emptiness of this little place of flesh you 
carry around and call your soul, your entity, is the same 
emptiness in every direction of space unmeasurable emptiness, the 
same, one, and holy emptiness everywhere: why be selfy and unfree, 
Man God, in your dream? Wake up, thou'rt selfless and free.  "Even 
and upright your mind abides nowhere," states Hui Neng of China.  
We're all in heaven now.<P>

28<BR>
Roaring dreams take place in a perfectly silent mind.  Now that we 
know this, throw the raft away.<P>

29<BR>
Are you tightwad and are you mean, those are the true sins, and 
sin is only a conception of ours, due to long habit.  Are you 
generous and are you kind, those are the true virtues, and they're 
only conceptions.  The golden eternity rests beyond sin and 
virtue, is attached to neither, is attached to nothing, is 
unattached, because the golden eternity is Alone.  The mold has 
rills but it is one mold.  The field has curves but it is one 
field.  All things are different forms of the same thing.  I call 
it the golden eternity-what do you call it, brother? for the 
blessing and merit of virtue, and the punishment and bad fate of 
sin, are alike just so many words.<P>

30<BR>
Sociability is a big smile, and a big smile is nothing but teeth.  
Rest and be kind.<P>

31<BR>
There's no need to deny that evil thing called GOOGOO, which 
doesnt exist, just as there's no need to deny that evil thing 
called Sex and Rebirth, which also doesn't exist, as it is only a 
form of emptiness.  The bead of semen comes from a long line of 
awakened natures that were your parent, a holy flow, a succession 
of saviors pouring from the womb of the dark void and back into 
it, fantastic magic imagination of the lightning, flash, plays, 
dreams, not even plays, dreams.<P>

32<BR>
"The womb of exuberant fertility," Ashvhaghosha called it, 
radiating forms out of its womb of exuberant emptiness.  In 
emptiness there is no Why, no knowledge of Why, no ignorance of 
Why, no asking and no answering of Why, and no significance 
attached to this.<P>

33<BR>
A disturbed and frightened man is like the golden eternity 
experimentally pretending at feeling the disturbed-and-frightened 
mood; a calm and joyous man, is like the golden eternity 
pretending at experimenting with that experience; a man 
experiencing his Sentient Being, is like the golden eternity 
pretending at trying that out too; a man who has no thoughts, is 
like the golden eternity pretending at being itself; because the 
emptiness of everything has no beginning and no end and at present 
is infinite.<P>

34<BR>
"Love is all in all," said Sainte Therese, choosing Love for her 
vocation and pouring out her happiness, from her garden by the 
gate, with a gentle smile, pouring roses on the earth, so that the 
beggar in the thunderbolt received of the endless offering of her 
dark void.  Man goes a-beggaring into nothingness.  "Ignorance is 
the father, Habit-Energy is the Mother." Opposites are not the 
same for the same reason they are the same.<P>

35<BR>
The words "atoms of dust" and "the great universes" are only 
words.  The idea that they imply is only an idea.  The belief that 
we live here in this existence, divided into various beings, 
passing food in and out of ourselves, and casting off husks of 
bodies one after another with no cessation and no definite or 
particular discrimination, is only an idea.  The seat of our 
Immortal Intelligence can be seen in that beating light between 
the eyes the Wisdom Eye of the ancients: we know what we're doing: 
we're not disturbed: because we're like the golden eternity 
pretending at playing the magic cardgame and making believe it's 
real, it's a big dream, a joyous ecstasy of words and ideas and 
flesh, an ethereal flower unfolding a folding back, a movie, an 
exuberant bunch of lines bounding emptiness, the womb of 
Avalokitesvara, a vast secret silence, springtime in the Void, 
happy young gods talking and drinking on a cloud.  Our 32,000 
chillicosms bear all the marks of excellence.  Blind milky light 
fills our night; and the morning is crystal.<P>

36<BR>
Give a gift to your brother, but there's no gift to compare with 
the giving of assurance that he is the golden eternity.  The true 
understanding of this would bring tears to your eyes.  The other 
shore is right here, forgive and forget, protect and reassure.  
Your tormenters will be purified.  Raise thy diamond hand.  Have 
faith and wait.  The course of your days is a river rumbling over 
your rocky back.  You're sitting at the bottom of the world with a 
head of iron.  Religion is thy sad heart.  You're the golden 
eternity and it must be done by you.  And means one thing: 
Nothing-Ever-Happened.  This is the golden eternity.<P>

37<BR>
When the Prince of the Kalinga severed the flesh from the limbs 
and body of Buddha, even then the Buddha was free from any such 
ideas as his own self, other self, living beings divided into many 
selves, or living beings united and identified into one eternal 
self.  The golden eternity isnt "me." Before you can know that 
you're dreaming you'll wake up, Atman.  Had the Buddha, the 
Awakened One, cherished any of these imaginary judgments of and 
about things, he would have fallen into impatience and hatred in 
his suffering.  Instead, like Jesus on the Cross he saw the light 
and died kind, loving all living things.<P>

38<BR>
The world was spun out of a blade of grass: the world was spun out 
of a mind.  Heaven was spun out of a blade of grass: heaven was 
spun out of a mind.  Neither will do you much good, neither will 
do you much harm.  The Oriental imperturbed, is the golden 
eternity.<P>

39<BR>
He is called a Yogi, his is called a Priest, a Minister, a 
Brahmin, a Parson, a Chaplain, a Roshi, a Laoshih, a Master, a 
Patriarch, a Pope, a Spiritual Commissar, a Counselor, and 
Adviser, a Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, an Old Man, a Saint, a Shaman, 
a Leader, who thinks nothing of himself as separate from another 
self, not higher nor lower, no stages and no definite attainments, 
no mysterious stigmata or secret holyhood, no wild dark knowledge 
and no venerable authoritativeness, nay a giggling sage sweeping 
out of the kitchen with a broom.  After supper, a silent smoke.  
Because there is no definite teaching: the world is undisciplined.  
Nature endlessly in every direction inward to your body and 
outward into space.<P>

40<BR>
Meditate outdoors.  The dark trees at night are not really the 
dark trees at night, it's only the golden eternity.<P>

41<BR>
A mosquito as big as Mount Everest is much bigger than you think: 
a horse's hoof is more delicate than it looks.  An altar 
consecrated to the golden eternity, filled with roses and lotuses 
and diamonds, is the cell of the humble prisoner, the cell so cold 
and dreary.  Boethius kissed the Robe of the Mother Truth in a 
Roman dungeon.<P>

42<BR>
Do you think the emptiness of the sky will ever crumble away? 
Every little child knows that everybody will go to heaven.  
Knowing that nothing ever happened is not really knowing that 
nothing ever happened, it's the golden eternity.  In other words, 
nothing can compare with telling your brother and your sister that 
what happened, what is happening, and what will happen, never 
really happened, is not really happening and never will happen, it 
is only the golden eternity.  Nothing was ever born, nothing will 
ever die.  Indeed, it didnt even happen that you heard about 
golden eternity through the accidental reading of this scripture.  
The thing is easily false.  There are no warnings whatever issuing 
from the golden eternity: do what you want.<P>

43<BR>
Even in dreams be kind, because anyway there is no time, no space, 
no mind.  "It's all not-born," said Bankei of Japan, whose mother 
heard this from her son did what we call "died happy." And even if 
she had died unhappy, dying unhappy is not really dying unhappy, 
it's the golden eternity.  It's impossible to exist, it's 
impossible to be persecuted, it's impossible to miss your reward.<P>

44<BR>
Eight hundred and four thousand myriads of Awakened Ones 
throughout numberless swirls of epochs appeared to work hard to 
save a grain of sand, and it was only the golden eternity.  And 
their combined reward will be no greater and no lesser than what 
will be won by a piece of dried turd.  It's a reward beyond 
thought.<P>

45<BR>
When you've understood this scripture, throw it away.  If you cant 
understand this scripture, throw it away.  I insist on your 
freedom.<P>

46<BR>
O everlasting Eternity, all things and all truth laws are no-
things, in three ways, which is the same way: AS THINGS OF TIME 
they dont exist because there is no furthest atom than can be 
found or weighed or grasped, it is emptiness through and through, 
matter and empty space too.  AS THINGS OF MIND they dont exist, 
because the mind that conceives and makes them out does so by 
seeing, hearing touching, smelling, tasting, and mentally-noticing 
and without this mind they would not be seen or heard or felt or 
smelled or tasted or mentally-noticed, they are discriminated that 
which they're not necessarily by imaginary judgments of the mind, 
they are actually dependent on the mind that makes them out, by 
themselves they are no-things, they are really mental, seen only 
of the mind, they are really empty visions of the mind, heaven is 
a vision, everything is a vision.  What does it mean that I am in 
this endless universe thinking I'm a man sitting under the stars 
on the terrace of earth, but actually empty and awake throughout 
the emptiness and awakedness of everything?  It means that I am 
empty and awake, knowing that I am empty and awake, and that 
there's no difference between me and anything else. It means that 
I have attained to that which everything is.<P>

47<BR>
The-Attainer-To-That-Which-Everything-Is, the Sanskrit Tathagata, 
has no ideas whatever but abides in essence identically with the 
essence of all things, which is what it is, in emptiness and 
silence.  Imaginary meaning stretched to make mountains and as far 
as the germ is concerned it stretched even further to make 
molehills.  A million souls dropped through hell but nobody saw 
them or counted them.  A lot of large people isnt really a lot of 
large people, it's only the golden eternity.  When St. Francis 
went to heaven he did not add to heaven nor detract from earth.  
Locate silence, possess space, spot me the ego.  "From the 
beginning," said the Sixth Patriarch of the China School, "not a 
thing is."<P>

48<BR>
He who loves all life with his pity and intelligence isnt really 
he who loves all life with his pity and intelligence, it's only 
natural.  The universe is fully known because it is ignored.  
Enlightenment comes when you dont care.  This is a good tree stump 
I'm sitting on.  You cant even grasp your own pain let alone your 
eternal reward.  I love you because you're me.  I love you because 
there's nothing else to do.  It's just the natural golden 
eternity.<P>

49<BR>
What does it mean that those trees and mountains are magic and 
unreal?- It means that those trees and mountains are magic and 
unreal.  What does it mean that those trees and mountains are not 
magic but real?- it means that those trees and mountains are not 
magic but real.  Men are just making imaginary judgments both 
ways, and all the time it's just the same natural golden eternity.<P>

50<BR>
If the golden eternity was anything other than mere words, you 
could not have said "golden eternity."  This means that the words 
are used to point at the endless nothingness of reality. If the 
endless nothingness of reality was anything other than mere words, 
you could not have said "endless nothingness of reality," you 
could not have said it. This means that the golden eternity is out 
of our word-reach, it refuses steadfastly to be described, it runs 
away from us and leads us in.  The name is not really the name.  
The same way, you could not have said "this world" if this world 
was anything other than mere words.  There's nothing there but 
just that.  They've long known that there's nothing to life but 
just the living of it.  It Is What It Is and That's All It Is.<P>

51<BR>
There's no system of teaching and no reward for teaching the 
golden eternity, because nothing has happened.  In the golden 
eternity teaching and reward havent even vanished let alone 
appeared.  The golden eternity doesnt even have to be perfect.  It 
is very silly of me to talk about it.  I talk about it simply 
because here I am dreaming that I talk about it in a dream already 
ended, ages ago, from which I'm already awake, and it was only an 
empty dreaming, in fact nothing whatever, in fact nothing ever 
happened at all. The beauty of attaining the golden eternity is 
that nothing will be acquired, at last.<P>

52<BR>
Kindness and sympathy, understanding and encouragement, these 
give: they are better than just presents and gifts: no reason in 
the world why not.  Anyhow, be nice. Remember the golden eternity 
is yourself.  "If someone will simply practice kindness," said 
Gotama to Subhuti, "he will soon attain highest perfect wisdom."  
Then he added: "Kindness after all is only a word and it should be 
done on the spot without thought of kindness."  By practicing 
kindness all over with everyone you will soon come into the holy 
trance, infinite distinctions of personalities will become what 
they really mysteriously are, our common and eternal blissstuff, 
the pureness of everything forever, the great bright essence of 
mind, even and one thing everywhere the holy eternal milky love, 
the white light everywhere everything, emptybliss, svaha, shining, 
ready, and awake, the compassion in the sound of silence, the 
swarming myriad trillionaire you are.<P>

53<BR>
Everything's alright, form is emptiness and emptiness is form, and 
we're here forever, in one form or another, which is empty.  
Everything's alright, we're not here, there, or anywhere.  
Everything's alright, cats sleep.<P>

54<BR>
The everlasting and tranquil essence, look around and see the 
smiling essence everywhere.  How wily was the world made, Maya, 
not-even-made.<P>

55<BR>
There's the world in the daylight.  If it was completely dark you 
wouldnt see it but it would still be there.  If you close your 
eyes you really see what it's like: mysterious particle-swarming 
emptiness.  On the moon big mosquitos of straw know this in the 
kindness of their hearts.  Truly speaking, unrecognizably sweet it 
all is.  Don't worry about nothing.<P>

56<BR>
Imaginary judgments about things, in the Nothing-Ever-Happened 
wonderful void, you dont even have to reject them, let alone 
accept them.  "That looks like a tree, let's call it a tree," said 
Coyote to Earthmaker at the beginning, and they walked around the 
rootdrinker patting their bellies.<P>

57<BR>
Perfectly selfless, the beauty of it, the butterfly doesnt take it 
as a personal achievement, he just disappears through the trees.  
You too, kind and humble and not-even-here, it wasnt in a greedy 
mood that you saw the light that belongs to everybody.<P>

58<BR>
Look at your little finger, the emptiness of it is no different 
that the emptiness of infinity.<P>

59<BR>
Cats yawn because they realize that there's nothing to do.<P>

60<BR>
Up in heaven you wont remember all these tricks of yours.  You 
wont even sigh "Why?"  Whether as atomic dust or as great cities, 
what's the difference in all this stuff.  A tree is still only a 
rootdrinker.  The puma's twisted face continues to look at the 
blue sky with sightless eyes, Ah sweet divine and indescribable 
verdurous paradise planted in mid-air! Caitanya, it's only 
consciousness.  Not with thoughts of your mind, but in the 
believing sweetness of your heart, you snap the link and open the 
golden door and disappear into the bright room, the everlasting 
ecstasy, eternal Now.  Soldier, follow me! - there never was a 
war.  Arjuna, dont fight! - why fight over nothing?  Bless and sit 
down.<P>

61<BR>
I remember that I'm supposed to be a man and consciousness and I 
focus my eyes and the print reappears and the words of the poor 
book are saying, "The world, as God has made it" and there are no 
words in my pitying heart to express the knowless loveliness of 
the trance there was before I read those words, I had no such idea 
that there was a world.<P>

62<BR>
This world has no marks, signs, or evidence of existence, nor the 
noises in it, like accident of wind or voices or heehawing 
animals, yet listen closely the eternal hush of silence goes on 
and on throughout all this, and has been gong on, and will go on 
and on.  This is because the world is nothing but a dream and is 
just thought of and the everlasting eternity pays no attention to 
it.  At night under the moon, or in a quiet room, hush now, the 
secret music of the Unborn goes on and on, beyond conception, 
awake beyond existence.  Properly speaking, awake is not really 
awake because the golden eternity never went to sleep; you can 
tell by the constant sound of Silence which cuts through this 
world like a magic diamond through the trick of your not realizing 
that your mind caused the world.<P>

63<BR>
The God of the American Plateau Indian was Coyote.  He says: 
"Earth! those beings living on your surface, none of them 
disappearing, will all be transformed.  When I have spoken to 
them, when they have spoken to me, from that moment on, their 
words and their bodies which they usually use to move about with, 
will all change.  I will not have heard them."<P>

64<BR>
I was smelling flowers in the yard, and when I stood up I took a 
deep breath and the blood all rushed to my brain and I woke up 
dead on my back in the grass. I had apparently fainted, or died, 
for about sixty seconds. My neighbor saw me but he thought I had 
just suddenly thrown myself on the grass to enjoy the sun.  During 
that timeless moment of unconsciousness I saw the golden eternity.  
I saw heaven.  In it nothing had ever happened, the events of a 
million years ago were just as phantom and ungraspable as the 
events of now, or the events of the next ten minutes.  It was 
perfect, the golden solitude, the golden emptiness, Something-Or-
Other, something surely humble.  There was a rapturous ring of 
silence abiding perfectly.  There was no question of being alive 
or not being alive, of likes and dislikes, of near or far, no 
question of giving or gratitude, no question of mercy or judgment, 
or of suffering or its opposite or anything.  It was the womb 
itself, aloneness, alaya vijnana the universal store, the Great 
Free Treasure, the Great Victory, infinite completion, the joyful 
mysterious essence of Arrangement.  It seemed like one smiling 
smile, one adorable adoration, one gracious and adorable charity, 
everlasting safety, refreshing afternoon, roses, infinite 
brilliant immaterial gold ash, the Golden Age.  The "golden" came 
from the sun in my eyelids, and the "eternity" from my sudden 
instant realization as I woke up that I had just been where it all 
came from and where it was all returning, the everlasting So, and 
so never coming or going; therefore I call it the golden eternity 
but you can call it anything you want.  As I regained 
consciousness I felt so sorry I had a body and a mind suddenly 
realizing I didn't even have a body and a mind and nothing had 
ever happened and everything is alright forever and forever and 
forever, O thank you thank you thank you.<P>

65<BR>
This is the first teaching from the golden eternity.<P>

66<BR>
The second teaching from the golden eternity is that there never 
was a first teaching from the golden eternity.  So be sure.<P>
