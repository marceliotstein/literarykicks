'At dawn a little bird blessed me' <P>

<I>(From Chapter 16: Ray Smith is trying to hop onto a freight train)</I> <P>

At seven-thirty my Zipper came in and was being made up by the switchmen
and I hid in the weeds to catch it, hiding partly behind a telephone pole.  
It pulled out, surprisingly fast I thought, and with my heavy fifty-pound 
rucksack I ran out and trotted along till I saw an agreeable drawbar and
took a hold of it and hauled on and climbed straight to the top of the box
to have a good look at the whole train and see where my flatcar'd be.  Holy
smokes goddamn and all ye falling candles of heaven smash, but as the train 
picked up tremendous momentum and tore out of that yard I saw it was a 
bloody no-good eighteen-car sealed sonofabitch and at almost twenty miles
an hour it was do or die, get off or hang on to my life at eighty miles per
(impossible on a boxcar top) so I had to scramble down the rungs again but
first I had to untangle my strap clip from where it had caught in the catwalk
on top so by the time I was hanging from the lowest rung and ready to drop off
we were going too fast now.  Slinging the rucksack and holding it hard in one
hand calmly and madly I stepped off hoping for the best and turned everything 
away and only staggered a few feet and I was safe on ground.<P>

But now I was three miles into the industrial jungle of L.A. in mad sick 
sniffling smog night and had to sleep all that night by a wire fence in a
ditch by the tracks being waked up all night by rackets of Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe switchers bellyaching around, till fog and clear of midnight when 
I breathed better (thinking and praying in my sack) but then more fog and smog 
again and horrible damp white cloud of dawn and my bag too hot to sleep in and
outside too raw to stand, nothing but horror all night long, except at dawn a
little bird blessed me. <P>

The only thing to do was to get out of L.A.  According to my friend's 
instructions I stood on my head, using the wire fence to prevent me from
falling over.  It made my cold feel a little better.  Then I walked to the
bus station (through tracks and side streets) and caught a cheap bus 
twenty-five miles to Riverside.  Cops kept looking at me suspiciously with 
that big bag on my back.  Everything was far away from the easy purity of
being with Japhy Ryder in that high rock camp under peaceful singing stars. <P>
