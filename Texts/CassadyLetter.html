(March 7, 1947)</H3>

Dear Jack:, <P>

I am sitting in a bar on Market St.  I'm drunk, well, not quite,
but I soon will be.  I am here for 2 reasons; I must wait 5 hours
for the bus to Denver & lastly but, most importantly, I'm here
(drinking) because, of course, because of a woman & <I>what a 
woman!</I>  To be chronological about it: <P>

I was sitting on the bus when it took on more passengers at Indianapolis,
Indiana -- a perfectly proportioned beautiful, intellectual, passionate,
personification of Venus De Milo asked me if the seat beside me was 
taken!!! I gulped, (I'm drunk) gargled & stammered NO! (Paradox of 
expression, after all, how can one stammer No!!?)  She sat -- I sweated --
She started to speak, I knew it would be generalities, so to tempt her I
remained silent. <P>

She (her name Patricia) got on the bus at 8 PM (Dark!) I didn't speak 
until 10 PM -- in the intervening 2 hours I not only of course, determined
to make her, but, how to <I>DO IT</I>. <P>

I naturally can't quote the conversation verbally, however, I shall attempt
to give you the gist of it from 10 PM to 2 AM. <P>

Without the slightest preliminaries of objective remarks (what's your 
name? where are you going? etc.) I plunged into a completely knowing, 
completely subjective, personal & so to speak "penetrating her core"
way of speech; to be shorter (since I'm getting unable to write) by 2 
AM I had her swearing eternal love, complete subjectivity to me & 
immediate satisfaction.  I, anticipating even more pleasure, wouldn't 
allow her to blow me on the bus, instead we played, as they say, with
each other. <P>

Knowing her supremely perfect being was completely mine (when I'm more
coherent, I'll tell you her complete history & psychological reason for
loving me) I could concieve of no obstacle to my satisfaction, well "the
best laid plans of mice & men go astray" and my nemesis was her sister, 
the bitch. <P>

Pat had told me her reason for going to St. Louis was to see her sister;
she had wired her to meet her at the depot.  So, to get rid of the sister, 
we peeked around the depot when we arrived at St. Louis at 4 AM to see if
she (her sister) was present.  If not, Pat would claim her suitcase, change 
clothes in the rest room & she and I proceed to a hotel room for a night
(years?) of perfect bliss.  The sister was not in sight, so She (not the
capital) claimed her bag & retired to the toilet to change ---- long dash 
---- <P>

This next paragraph must, of necessity, be written completely objectively 
-- <P>

Edith (her sister) & Patricia (my love) walked out of the pisshouse hand
in hand (I shan't describe my emotions).  It seems Edith (bah) arrived at
the bus depot early & while waiting for Patricia, feeling sleepy, retired 
to the head to sleep on a sofa.  That's why Pat & I didn't see her.<P>

My desperate efforts to free Pat from Edith failed, even Pat's terror & 
slave-like feeling toward her rebelled enough to state she must see 
"someone" & would meet Edith later, <I>all</I> failed.  Edith was wise; 
she saw what was happening between Pat & I. <P>

Well, to summarize: Pat & I stood in the depot (in plain sight of the
sister) & pushing up to one another, vowed to never love again & then I 
took the bus to Kansas City & Pat went home, meekly, with her dominating
sister.  Alas, alas ---- <P>

In complete (try & share my feeling) dejection, I sat, as the bus 
progressed toward Kansas City.  At Columbia, Mo. a young (19) completely
passive (my meat) <I>virgin</I> got on & shared my seat ... In my dejection
over losing Pat, the perfect, I decided to sit on the bus (behind the driver)
in broad daylight & seduce her, from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM I talked.  When I 
was done, she (confused, her entire life upset, metaphysically amazed at 
me, passionate in her immaturity) called her folks in Kansas City, & went with
me to a park (it was just getting dark) & I banged her; I screwed as never 
before; all my pent up emotion finding release in this young virgin (& she 
was) who is, by the way, a <I>school teacher!</I>  Imagine, she's had 2
years of Mo. St. Teacher's College & now teaches Jr. High School.  (I'm 
beyond thinking straightly). <P>

I'm going to stop writing.  Oh, yes, to free myself for a moment
from my emotions, you must read 'Dead Souls' parts of it (in which 
Gogol shows his insight) are quite like you. <P>

I'll elaborate further later (probably?) but at the moment I'm drunk and
happy (after all, I'm free of Patricia already, due to the young virgin.  
I have no name for her.  At the happy note of Les Young's 'jumping at 
Mesners' (which I'm hearing) I close till later.<P>
