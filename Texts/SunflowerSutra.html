<H3>Sunflower Sutra by 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A></H3>

This poem was written in 1955.  The sunflower has a special meaning for 
Ginsberg, whose life was changed by an earlier vision of 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamBlake.html">William Blake</A>
reading his own poem "Ah! Sunflower," in an East Harlem apartment.<P>

As with so many Ginsberg poems, the note is defiance. <P>

Sunflower Sutra<BR> 
---------------<BR>
by Allen Ginsberg<P>

I walked on the banks of the tincan banana dock and sat down 
     under the huge shade of a Southern Pacific locomotive to look 
     for the sunset over the box house hills and cry.<P>
Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron pole, companion, 
     we thought the same thoughts of the soul, bleak and blue and 
     sad-eyed, surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of 
     machinery.<P>
The only water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun sank on top 
     of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that stream, no hermit in 
     those mounts, just ourselves rheumy-eyed and hung-over like 
     old bums on the riverbank, tired and wily.<P>
Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray shadow 
     against the sky, big as a man, sitting dry on top of a pile 
     of ancient sawdust--<P>
--I rushed up enchanted--it was my first sunflower, memories of 
     Blake--my visions--Harlem<P>
and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes greasy 
     Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black treadless tires 
     forgotten and unretreaded, the poem of the riverbank, condoms
     & pots, steel knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck and
     the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the past--<P>
and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset, crackly bleak and
     dusty with the smut and smog and smoke of olden locomotives
     in its eye--<P>
corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like a battered 
     crown, seeds fallen out of its face, soon-to-be-toothless
     mouth of sunny air, sunrays obliterated on its hairy head like
     a dried wire spiderweb,<P>
leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures from the sawdust
     root, broke pieces of plaster fallen out of the black twigs, a 
     dead fly in its ear,<P>
Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O my soul, I loved
     you then!<P>
The grime was no man's grime but death and human locomotives,<P>
all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad skin, that 
     smog of cheek, that eyelid of black mis'ry, that sooty hand or 
     phallus or protuberance of artificial worse-than-dirt--industrial--
     modern--all that civilization spotting your crazy golden crown--<P>
and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless eyes and ends
     and withered roots below, in the home-pile of sand and sawdust,
     rubber dollar bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards of the
     weeping coughing car, the empty lonely tincans with their rusty 
     tongues alack, what more could I name, the smoked ashes of some
     cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the milky breasts of cars,
     wornout asses out of chairs & sphincters of dynamos--all these<P>
entangled in your mummied roots--and you standing before me in the 
     sunset, all your glory in your form!<P>
A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent lovely sunflower
     existence! a sweet natural eye to the new hip moon, woke up alive
     and excited grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden monthly
     breeze!<P>
How many flies buzzed round you innocent of your grime, while you 
     cursed the heavens of your railroad and your flower soul?<P>
Poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a flower? when did you
     look at your skin and decide you were an impotent dirty old 
     locomotive? the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and shade of
     a once powerful mad American locomotive?<P>
You were never no locomotive, Sunflower, you were a sunflower!<P>
And you Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me not!<P>
So I grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck it at my side
     like a scepter,<P>
and deliver my sermon to my soul, and Jack's soul too, and anyone who'll
     listen,<P>
--We're not our skin of grime, we're not our dread bleak dusty imageless
     locomotive, we're all golden sunflowers inside, blessed by our own
     seed & hairy naked accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black formal
     sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our eyes under the shadow of the
     mad locomotive riverbank sunset Frisco hilly tincan evening sitdown
     vision.<P>
