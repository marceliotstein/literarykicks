'The origin of faceless wonderless crapulous civilization'<P>

<I>(From Chapter 6: Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder are on the campus of
the University of California at Berkeley)</I> <P>

We pushed the bike down past the various college hangouts and
cafeterias and looked into Robbie's to see if we knew anybody.  
Alvah was in there, working his part-time job as busboy.  Japhy and I
were kind of outlandish-looking on the campus in our old clothes in fact
Japhy was considered an eccentric around the campus, which is the usual thing
for campuses and college people to think whenever a real man appears on the
scene -- college being nothing but grooming schools for the middle-class
non-identity which usually finds its perfect expression on the outskirts of 
the campus in rows of well-to-do houses with lawns and television sets in each
living room with everybody looking at the same thing at the same time while the
Japhies of the world go prowling in the wilderness to hear the voice crying 
in the dark mysterious secret of the origin of faceless wonderless crapulous
civilization.  'All these people,' said Japhy, 'they all got white-tiled
toilets and take big dirty craps like bears in the mountains, but it's all
washed away to convenient supervised sewers and nobody thinks of crap any
more or realizes their origin is shit and civet and scum of the sea.  They 
spend all day washing their hands with creamy soaps they secretly wanta eat
in the bathroom.' <P>
