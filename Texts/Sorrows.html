<H3>'I Have Folded My Sorrows' by 
<A HREF="../People/BobKaufman.html">Bob Kaufman</A></H3> 

I have folded my sorrows into the mantle of summer night,<BR>
Assigning each brief storm its alloted space in time,<BR>
Quietly pursuing catastrophic histories buried in my eyes.<BR>
And yes, the world is not some unplayed Cosmic Game,<BR>
And the sun is still ninety-three million miles from me,<BR>
And in the imaginary forest, the shingles hippo becomes
	the gay unicorn.<BR>
No, my traffic is not addled keepers of yesterday's 
	disasters,<BR>
Seekers of manifest disewbowelment on shafts of yesterday's
	pains.<BR>
Blues come dressed like introspective echoes of a journey.<BR>
And yes, I have searched the rooms of the moon on cold
	summer nights.<BR>
And yes, I have refought those unfinished encounters.
	Still, they remain unfinished.<BR>
And yes, I have at times wished myself something different.<P>

The tragedies are sung nightly at the funerals of the poet;<BR>
The revisited soul is wrapped in the aura of familiarity.<P>
