<I>'Nobody knows where Slim Gaillard is'</I><P>

'... one night we suddenly went mad together again; we went to see Slim
Gaillard in a little Frisco nightclub.  Slim Gaillard is a tall, thin 
Negro with big sad eyes who's always saying 'Right-orooni' and 'How 'bout
a little bourbon-arooni.'  In Frisco great eager crowds of young
semi-intellectuals sat at his feet and listened to him on the piano, 
guitar and bongo drums.  When he gets warmed up he takes off his 
undershirt and really goes.  He does and says anything that comes into
his head.  He'll sing 'Cement Mixer, Put-ti Put-ti' and suddenly slow
down the beat and brood over his bongos with fingertips barely tapping
the skin as everybody leans forward breathlessly to hear; you think he'll
do this for a minute or so, but he goes right on, for as long as an hour, 
making an imperceptible little noise with the tips of his fingernails, 
smaller and smaller all the time till you can't hear it any more and 
sounds of traffic come in the open door.  Then he slowly gets up and takes 
the mike and says, very slowly, 'Great-orooni ... fine-ovauti ... 
hello-orooni ... bourbon-orooni ... all-orooni ... how are the boys in the 
front row making out with their girls-orooni ... orooni ... vauti ... 
oroonirooni ..."  He keeps this up for fifteen minutes, his voice getting 
softer and softer till you can't hear.  His great sad eyes scan the 
audience. <P>

Dean stands in the back, saying, 'God! Yes!' -- and clasping his hands in 
prayer and sweating.  'Sal, Slim knows time, he knows time.'  Slim sits
down at the piano and hits two notes, two C's, then two more, then one, 
then two, and suddenly the big burly bass-player wakes up from a reverie
and realizes Slim is playing 'C-Jam Blues' and he slugs in his big 
forefinger on the string and the big booming beat begins and everybody
starts rocking and Slim looks just as sad as ever, and they blow jazz
for half an hour, and then Slim goes mad and grabs the bongos and plays
tremendous rapid Cubana beats and yells crazy things in Spanish, in Arabic,
in Peruvian dialect, in Egyptian, in every language he knows, and he knows
innumerable languages.  Finally the set is over; each set takes two hours.  
Slim Gaillard goes and stands against a post, looking sadly over everybody's
head as people come to talk to him.  A bourbon is slipped into his hand.  
'Bourbon-orooni -- thank-you-ovauti ...' Nobody knows where Slim Gaillard 
is.  Dean once had a dream that he was having a baby and his belly was 
all bloated up blue as he lay on the grass of a California hospital.  Under
a tree, with a group of colored men, sat Slim Gaillard.  Dean turned 
despairing eyes of a mother to him.  Slim said, 'There you go-orooni.'  Now
Dean approached him, he approached his God; he thought Slim was God; he 
shuffled and bowed in front of him and asked him to join us.  'Right-orooni,'
says Slim; he'll join anybody but won't guarantee to be there with you in
spirit.  Dean got a table, bought drinks, and sat stiffly in front of Slim.
Slim dreamed over his head.  Every time Slim said, 'Orooni,' Dean said 
'Yes!'  I sat there with these two madmen.  Nothing happened.  To Slim 
Gaillard the whole world was just one big orooni.'<P>
