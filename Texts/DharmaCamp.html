'There's nothing wrong with you Ray'<P>

<I>(From Chapter 9: Japhy Ryder and Ray Smith are camping out after a day of 
mountain climbing) </I> <P>

So we unpacked our packs and laid things out and smoked and had a good time.  
Now the mountains were getting that pink tinge, I mean the rocks, they were just
solid rock covered with the atoms of dust accumulated there since beginningless
time.  In fact I was afraid of those jagged monstrosities all around and over 
our heads. <P>

'They're so silent!' I said.<P>

'Yeah man, you know to me a mountain is a Buddha.  Think of the patience, 
hundreds of thousands of years just sitting there bein perfectly perfectly
silent and like praying for all living creatures in that silence and just
waiting for us to stop all our frettin and foolin.'  Japhy got out the tea,
Chinese tea, and sprinkled some in a tin pot, and had the fire going meanwhile,
a small one to begin with, the sun was still on us, and stuck a long stick 
tight down under a few big rocks and made himself something to hang the teapot
on and pretty soon the water was boiling and he poured it out steaming into the
tin pot and we had cups of tea with our tin cups.  I myself'd gotten the water
from the stream, which was cold and pure like snow and the crystal-lidded eyes
of heaven.  Therefore, the tea was by far the most pure and thirstquenching tea
I ever drank in all my life, it made you want to drink more and more, it 
actually quenched your thirst and of course it swam around hot in your belly.<P>

'Now you understand the Oriental passion for tea,' said Japhy.  'Remember that 
book I told you about the first sip is joy the second is gladness, the third is
serenity, the fourth is madness, the fifth is ecstasy.' <P>

'Just about old buddy.' <P>

The rock we were camped against was a marvel.  It was thirty feet high and 
thirty feet at base, a perfect square almost, and twisted trees arched over it u
and peeked down on us.  From the base it went outward, forming a concave, so if 
rain came we'd be partially covered.  'How did this immense sonumbitch ever get
here?' <P>

'It probably was left here by the retreating glacier.  See over there that field
of snow?' <P>

'Yeah.'<P>

'That's the glacier what's left of it.  Either that or this rock tumbled here 
from inconceivable prehistoric mountains we can't understand, or maybe it just
landed here when the friggin mountain range itself burst out of the ground in 
the Jurassic upheaval.  Ray when you're up here you're not sittin in a Berkeley
tea room.  This is the beginning and the end of the world right here.  Look at
all those patient Buddhas lookin at us saying nothing.' <P>

'And you come out here by yourself ...' <P>

'For weeks on end, just like John Muir, climb around all by myself following 
quartzite veins or making posies of flowers for my camp, or just walking around
naked singing, and cook my supper and laugh.' <P>

'Japhy I gotta hand it to you, you're the happiest little cat in the world and
the greatest by God you are.  I'm sure glad I'm learning all this.  This place
makes me feel devoted, too, I mean, you know I have a prayer, did you know the
prayer I use?' <P>

'What?' <P>

'I sit down and say, and I run all my friends and relatives and enemies one by
one in this, without entertaining any angers or gratitudes or anything, and I 
say, like 'Japhy Ryder, equally empty, equally to be loved, equally a coming
Buddha,' then I run on, say to 'David O. Selznick, equally empty, equally to
be loved, equally a coming Buddha' though I don't use names like David O. 
Selznick, just people I know because when I say the words 'equally a coming
Buddha' I want to be thinking of their eyes, like you take Morley, his blue 
eyes behind those glasses, when you think 'equally a coming Buddha' you think
of those eyes and you really do suddenly see the true secret serenity and the 
truth of his coming Buddhahood.  Then you think of your enemy's eyes.' <P>

'That's great, Ray,' and Japhy took out his notebook and wrote down the prayer, 
and shook his head in wonder.  'That's really really great.  I'm going to teach
this prayer to the monks I meet in Japan.  There's nothing wrong with you Ray, 
your only trouble is you never learned to get out to spots like this, you've
let the world drown you in its horseshit and you've been vexed ... though as I 
say comparisons <I>are</I> odious, but what we're sayin now is true.' <P>
