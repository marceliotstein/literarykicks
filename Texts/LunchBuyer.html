'Bradley the Buyer'<P>

<I>(This short tale of an unfortunate narcotics agent is a typical passage 
from 'Naked Lunch.'  It's bizarre and weird and doesn't even make sense, and 
yet, somehow, it means ... something.  And it's funny as all hell.)</I><P>

'Selling is more of a habit than using,' Lupita says.  Nonusing pushers have
a contact habit, and that's one you can't kick.  Agents get it too.  Take
Bradley the Buyer.  Best narcotics agent in the industry.  Anyone would
make him for junk.  (Note: Make in the sense of dig or size up.)  I mean
he can walk up to a pusher and score direct.  He is so anonymous, grey and 
spectral the pusher don't remember him afterwards.  So he twists one after
the other ...<P>

Well the Buyer comes to look more and more like a junky.  He can't drink.  
He can't get it up.  His teeth fall out.  (Like pregnant women lose their 
teeth feeding the stranger, junkies lose their yellow fangs feeding the 
monkey.)  He is all the time sucking on a candy bar.  Baby Ruths he digs
special.  'It really disgust you to see the Buyer sucking on them candy
bars so nasty,' a cop says. <P>

The Buyer takes on an ominous grey-green color.  Fact is his body is making
its own junk or equivalent.  The Buyer has a steady connection.  A Man 
Within you might say.  Or so he thinks.  'I'll just set in my room,' he
says.  'Fuck 'em all.  Squares on both sides.  I am the only complete
man in the industry.' <P>

But a yen comes on him like a great black wind through the bones.  So the
Buyer hunts up a young junky and gives him a paper to make it. <P>

'Oh all right,' the boy says.  'So what you want to make?' <P>

'I just want to rub against you and get fixed.' <P>

'Ugh ... Well all right ... But why cancha just get physical like a 
human?' <P>

Later the boy is sitting in a Waldorf with two colleagues dunking pound
cake.  'Most distasteful thing I ever stand still for,' he says.  'Some 
way he make himself all soft like a blob of jelly and surround me so nasty.
Then he gets well all over like with green slime.  So I guess he come to 
some kinda awful climax ... I come near wigging with that green stuff all
over me, and he stink like a old rotten cantaloupe.' <P>

'Well it's still an easy score.' <P>

The boy signed resignedly; 'Yes, I guess you can get used to anything.  I've
got a meet with him again tomorrow.' <P>

The Buyer's habit keeps getting heavier.  He needs a recharge every half hour.
Sometimes he cruises the precincts and bribes the turnkey to let him in with
a cell of junkies.  It gets to where no amount of contact will fix him.  At 
this point he receives a summons from the District Supervisor: <P>

'Bradley, your conduct has given rise to rumors -- and I hope for your 
sake they are no more than that -- so unspeakably distasteful that ... I
mean Caesar's wife ... hrump ... that is, the Department must be above 
suspicion ... certainly above such suspicions as you have seemingly aroused.
You are lowering the entire tone of the industry.  We are prepared to accept
your immediate resignation.' <P>

The Buyer throws himself on the ground and crawls over to the D.S. 'No, Boss
Man, no ... The Department is my very lifeline.' <P>

He kisses the D.S.'s hand thrusting his fingers into his mouth (the D.S.
must feel his toothless gums) complaining he has lost his teeth 'inna 
thervith.'  'Please Boss Man, I'll wipe your ass, I'll wash out your dirty
condoms, I'll polish your shoes with the oil on my nose ...'<P>

'Really, this is most distasteful!  Have you no pride?  I must tell you I
feel a distinct revulsion.  I mean there is something, well, rotten about you,
and you smell like a compost heap.'  He put a scented handkerchief in front
of his face.  'I must ask you to leave this office at once.' <P>

'I'll do anything, Boss, <I>anything</I>.'  His ravaged green face splits in
a horrible smile.  'I'm still young, Boss, and I'm pretty strong when I get
my blood up.' <P>

The D.S. retches into his handkerchief and points to the door with a limp
hand.  The Buyer stands up looking at the D.S. dreamily.  His body begins to
dip like a dowser's wand.  He flows forward ... <P>

'No! No!' screams the D.S. <P>

'Schlup ... schlup schlup.'  An hour later they find the Buyer on the nod
in the D.S.'s chair.  The D.S. has disappeared without a trace. <P>

The Judge : 'Everything indicates that you have, in some unspeakable manner 
uh ... assimilated the District Supervisor.  Unfortunately there is no proof.
I would recommend that you be confined or more accurately contained in some
institution, but I know of no place suitable for a man of your caliber.  I
must reluctantly order your release.' <P>

'That one should stand in an aquarium,' says the arresting officer. <P>

The Buyer spreads terror throughout the industry.  Junkies and agents 
disappear.  Like a vampire bat he gives off a narcotic effluvium, a dank
green mist that anesthizes his victioms and renders them helpless in his 
enveloping presence.  And once he has scored he holes up for several days
like a gorged boa constrictor.  Finally he is caught in the act of digesting
the Narcotics Commissioner and destroyed with a flame thrower -- the court of 
inquiry ruling that such means were justified in that the Buyer had lost
his human citizenship and was, in consequence, a creature without species
and a menace to the narcotics industry on all levels.<P>
