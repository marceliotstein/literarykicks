<H3>YOWL</H3>

Robert McLachlan (R.McLachlan@massey.ac.nz) found this in an old 80's
issue of <I>The New Republic</I>, and was even nice enough to convert
it to HTML himself!  I suffered through the Reagan-happy years
of the 1980's, and I think this is a pretty cool parody.<P>

<H3>YOWL</H3>
On the 30th anniversary of "Howl." <P>

For Jay McInerney<p>
<b>I</b><p>
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by stress frazzled
overtired burnt-out <br>
jogging through suburban streets at dawn as suggested by the late James
Fixx, <br>
career-minded yupsters burning for an Amstel Light watching Stupid Pet
Tricks, <br>
who upwardly mobile and designer'd and bright-eyed and high sat up
working in the track-lit glow of the Tribeca loft skimming through the
Day Timer while padding the expense account, <br>
who passed through universities and saved their asses hallucinating
Grateful Dead posters and eating Sara Lee while watching the war on TV, <br>
who were graduated and went on to law schools burning to save the world,
<br>
who brewed decaffinated coffee doing their yoga in alligator shirts and
listening to the latest Windham Hill Sampler, <br>
who ate chocolate croissants in outdoor caf&eacute s and drank blush wine
on Columbus Avenue washed down with a little Percodan with Dove bars with
Diet coke with Lean Cuisine, <br>
stopping by on the way home for a pound of David's cookies telling each
other of their fears on intimacy and their need for space and inability
to commit - for now, <br>
who watched Mary Tyler Moore reruns and wept for Rhoda and worried about
acid rain and the mercury in the swordfish while strung out on cyclamates
faces flushed with MSG even after specifically making a point of
mentioning to the waiter not to put it in, <br>
who prowled through uncertain money markets chewing Tums and doing lines
with the Hispanics in the mail room sitting in the gents with
baby-laxative runs while the boss buzzes and the secretary says you're on
the phone to Bonn, <br>
who stayed up too late working out their relationships 'n' things feeling
the gnawing rat-fear that they hadn't been communicating lately and the
urgent pounding screaming need to think about their priorities, <br>
yacketayakking analyzing thinking it through making constructive
suggestions as the easstern sky flamed in raw Ralph Lauren pastels, <br>
got to get away for a few days but the Hartmann luggage is being repaired
oh, <br>
who needs this wandering through Needless-Markup wailing (inside) for the
baby seals and the bunnies slaughtered for lipstick remembering all the
unanswered anti-vivisection junk mail on the way to the appliances
section to beg another blade for the Cuisinart, <br>
who subscribed to <i>Gourmet</i> and the <i>American Lawyer</i> and after
an exhausting search found Jamaica time-shares in the classifieds for
only $1200 a month coping as best they could with the Negro beach boys
wanting to sell them ganja, <br>
paying outrageous sums for bottled water and having to complain about the
maid service and the warm orange juice knowing they should have gone to
Cape Cod instead where the Peugot mopeds fart carbon monoxide and the
half-eaten lobster rolls rot in wax paper on the sidewalks and the
Republican men in lime-green corduroys with little orange elephants bray
as their wives buy overpriced scrimshaw, <br>
who nudged and nuzzled over margaritas and dreamed of endless throbbing
hot sticky sex but Not tonite dear I have a yeast infection, <br>
running on spongy Reeboks to sublimate their lust then plunging into
<i>Bright Lights, Big City</i> <br>
who upped their nightly hits of Valium from two to five mgs and worried if
they were going to be groggy in the morning, <br>
who hollow-eyed and febrile read the theater reviews in unread issues of
the <i>New Yorker</i> yes the <i>New Yorker</i>, <br>
who watched re-reruns of Mary Tyler Moore and decided they hated Rhoda, <br>
who skimmed the Banana Republic catalog with brain-dead gaze wondering if
they really needed Ethiopian saddlebags, <br>
who padded back and forth to the john for endless glasses of water while
worrying about refinancing at ten and an eighth and waited for the
fiendish tweet of birds and the thud of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> on
the porch, <br>
who took a little tootsky after their Yoplait just to get going and
buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzed along in the carpool yattering to the
gray-flannelled bottisatvas in the backseat about rowing machines and
Eddie Murphy's homo jokes, <br>
ah Jay while you are not safe I am not safe and now <i>Ransom</i> is
remaindered at Waldenbooks and you're really in a bind - <br>
and who therefore drown in butter-flavored popcorn at the Cineplex as the
answering machines cutely speak to strangers and Discover cards are
mailed to the incorrect addresses while Mohawked clerks at Tower Records
with little crucifixes in their ears play "Pillow Talk" and everything
you want they only have in Beta.
