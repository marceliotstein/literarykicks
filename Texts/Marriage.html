<I>Thanks to Gene R. Truex (gene.r.truex@dartmouth.edu) for typing this 
wonderful poem in.<P></I>

Should I get married? Should I be good?<BR>
Astound the girl next door with my velvet suit and faustus hood?<BR>
Don't take her to movies but to cemeteries<BR>
tell all about werewolf bathtubs and forked clarinets<BR>
then desire her and kiss her and all the preliminaries<BR>
and she going just so far and I understanding why<BR>
not getting angry saying You must feel! It's beautiful to feel!<BR>
Instead take her in my arms lean against an old crooked tombstone<BR>
and woo her the entire night the constellations in the sky-<P>

When she introduces me to her parents<BR>
back straightened, hair finally combed, strangled by a tie,<BR>
should I sit with my knees together on their 3rd degree sofa<BR>
and not ask Where's the bathroom?<BR>
How else to feel other than I am,<BR>
often thinking Flash Gordon soap-<BR>
O how terrible it must be for a young man<BR>
seated before a family and the family thinking<BR>
We never saw him before! He wants our Mary Lou!<BR>
After tea and homemade cookies they ask What do you do for a living?<P>

Should I tell them? Would they like me then?<BR>
Say All right get married, we're losing a daughter<BR>
but we're gaining a son-<BR>
And should I then ask Where's the bathroom?<P>

O God, and the wedding! All her family and her friends<BR>
and only a handful of mine all scroungy and bearded<BR>
just wait to get at the drinks and food-<BR>
And the priest! he looking at me as if I masturbated<BR>
asking me Do you take this woman for your lawful wedded wife?<BR>
And I trembling what to say say Pie Glue!<BR>
I kiss the bride all those corny men slapping me on the back<BR>
She's all yours, boy! Ha-ha-ha!<BR>
And in their eyes you could see some obscene honeymoon going on-<BR>
Then all that absurd rice and clanky cans and shoes<BR>
Niagara Falls! Hordes of us! Husbands! Wives! Flowers! Chocolates!<BR>
All streaming into cozy hotels<BR>
All going to do the same thing tonight<BR>
The indifferent clerk he knowing what was going to happen<BR>
The lobby zombies they knowing what<BR>
The whistling elevator man he knowing<BR>
Everybody knowing! I'd almost be inclined not to do anything!<BR>
Stay up all night! Stare that hotel clerk in the eye!<BR>
Screaming: I deny honeymoon! I deny honeymoon!<BR>
running rampant into those almost climactic suites<BR>
yelling Radio belly! Cat shovel!<BR>
O I'd live in Niagara forever! in a dark cave beneath the Falls<BR>
I'd sit there the Mad Honeymooner<BR>
devising ways to break marriages, a scourge of bigamy<BR>
a saint of divorce-<P>

But I should get married I should be good<BR>
How nice it'd be to come home to her<BR>
and sit by the fireplace and she in the kitchen<BR>
aproned young and lovely wanting my baby<BR>
and so happy about me she burns the roast beef<BR>
and comes crying to me and I get up from my big papa chair<BR>
saying Christmas teeth! Radiant brains! Apple deaf!<BR>
God what a husband I'd make! Yes, I should get married!<BR>
So much to do! Like sneaking into Mr Jones' house late at night<BR>
and cover his golf clubs with 1920 Norwegian books<BR>
Like hanging a picture of Rimbaud on the lawnmower<BR>
like pasting Tannu Tuva postage stamps all over the picket fence<BR>
like when Mrs Kindhead comes to collect for the Community Chest<BR>
grab her and tell her There are unfavorable omens in the sky!<BR>
And when the mayor comes to get my vote tell him<BR>
When are you going to stop people killing whales!<BR>
And when the milkman comes leave him a note in the bottle<BR>
Penguin dust, bring me penguin dust, I want penguin dust-<P>

Yes if I should get married and it's Connecticut and snow<BR>
and she gives birth to a child and I am sleepless, worn,<BR>
up for nights, head bowed against a quiet window, the past behind me,<BR>
finding myself in the most common of situations a trembling man<BR>
knowledged with responsibility not twig-smear nor Roman coin soup-<BR>
O what would that be like!<BR>
Surely I'd give it for a nipple a rubber Tacitus<BR>
For a rattle a bag of broken Bach records<BR>
Tack Della Francesca all over its crib<BR>
Sew the Greek alphabet on its bib<BR>
And build for its playpen a roofless Parthenon<P>

No, I doubt I'd be that kind of father<BR>
Not rural not snow no quiet window<BR>
but hot smelly tight New York City<BR>
seven flights up, roaches and rats in the walls<BR>
a fat Reichian wife screeching over potatoes Get a job!<BR>
And five nose running brats in love with Batman<BR>
And the neighbors all toothless and dry haired<BR>
like those hag masses of the 18th century<BR>
all wanting to come in and watch TV<BR>
The landlord wants his rent<BR>
Grocery store Blue Cross Gas & Electric Knights of Columbus<BR>
impossible to lie back and dream Telephone snow, ghost parking-<BR>
No! I should not get married! I should never get married!<BR>
But-imagine if I were married to a beautiful sophisticated woman<BR>
tall and pale wearing an elegant black dress and long black gloves<BR>
holding a cigarette holder in one hand and a highball in the other<BR>
and we lived high up in a penthouse with a huge window<BR>
from which we could see all of New York and even farther on clearer days<BR>
No, can't imagine myself married to that pleasant prison dream-<P>

O but what about love? I forget love<BR>
not that I am incapable of love<BR>
It's just that I see love as odd as wearing shoes-<BR>
I never wanted to marry a girl who was like my mother<BR>
And Ingrid Bergman was always impossible<BR>
And there's maybe a girl now but she's already married<BR>
And I don't like men and-<BR>
But there's got to be somebody!<BR>
Because what if I'm 60 years old and not married,<BR>
all alone in a furnished room with pee stains on my underwear<BR>
and everybody else is married! All the universe married but me!<P>

Ah, yet well I know that were a woman possible as I am possible<BR>
then marriage would be possible-<BR>
Like SHE in her lonely alien gaud waiting her Egyptian lover<BR>
so i wait-bereft of 2,000 years and the bath of life.<P>
