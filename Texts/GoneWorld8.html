<PRE>
       It was a face which darkness could kill
                                          in an instant
        a face as easily hurt
                            by laughter or light

          'We <I>think</I> differently at night'
                                          she told me once
       lying back languidly

                           And she would quote Cocteau

      'I feel there is an angel in me' she'd say
                                        'whom I am constantly shocking'

          Then she would smile and look away 
                light a cigarette for me
                                        sigh and rise

     and stretch
                her sweet anatomy

                               let fall a stocking
