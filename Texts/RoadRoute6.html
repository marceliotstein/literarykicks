'It was my dream that screwed up'<P>

<I> (Here Sal Paradise (Kerouac) tries to make his first cross-country
trip alone, and doesn't get very far.)</I> <P>

I'd been poring over maps of the United States in Paterson for months,
even reading books about the pioneers and savoring names like Platte and
Cimarron and so on, and on the road-map was one long red line called Route
6 that led from the tip of Cape Cod clear to Ely, Nevada, and there dipped 
down to Los Angeles.  I'll just stay on all the way to Ely, I said to 
myself and confidently started.  To get to 6 I had to go up to Bear 
Mountain.  Filled with dreams of what I'd do in Chicago, in Denver, and 
then finally in San Fran, I took the Seventh Avenue Subway to the end of 
the line at 242nd Street, and there took a trolley into Yonkers; in downtown
Yonkers I transferred to an outgoing trolley and went to the city limits on 
the east bank of the Hudson River.  If you drop a rose in the Hudson River at
its mysterious source in the Adirondacks, think of all the places it journeys
as it goes to sea forever -- think of that wonderful Hudson Valley.  I started
hitching up the thing.  Five scattered rides took me to the desired Bear 
Mountain Bridge, where Route 6 arched in from New England.  It began to rain 
in torrents when I was let off there.  It was mountainous.  Route 6 came over
the river, wound around a traffic circle, and disappeared into the wilderness.
Not only was there no traffic but the rain come down in buckets and I had no
shelter.  I had to run under some pines to take cover; this did no good; I 
began crying and swearing and socking myself on the head for being such a
damn fool.  I was forty miles north of New York; all the way up I'd been worried
about the fact that on this, my big opening day, I was only moving north instead
of the so-longed for west.  Now I was stuck on my northermost hangup.  I ran a 
quarter-mile to an abandoned cute English-style filling station and stood under the dripping eaves.  High up over my head the great hairy Bear Mountain sent 
down thunderclaps that put the fear of God in me.  All I could see were smoky
trees and dismal wilderness rising to the skies.  "What the hell am I doing up
here?" I cursed, I cried for Chicago.  "Even now they're all having a big time,
they're doing this, I'm not there, when will I get there!" -- and so on.
Finally a car stopped at the empty filling station; the man and the two women
in it wanted to study a map.  I stepped right up and gestured in the rain; they
consulted; I looked like a maniac, of course, with my hair all wet, my shoes 
sopping.  My shoes, damn fool that I am, were Mexican huaraches, plantlike
sieves not fit for the rainly night of America and the raw road night.  But the
people let me in and rode me <I> back</I> to Newburgh, which I accepted as a 
better alternative than being trapped in the Bear Mountain wilderness all night.
"Besides," said the man, "there's no traffic passes through 6.  If you want to 
go to Chicago you'd be better going across the Holland Tunnel in New York and
head for Pittsburth," and I knew he was right.  It was my dream that screwed
up, the stupid hearthside idea that it would be wonderful to follow one great
red line across America instead of trying various roads and routes.  <P>

In Newburgh it had stopped raining.  I walked down to the river and I had to
ride back to New York in a bus with a delegation of schoolteachers coming 
back from a weekend in the mountains -- chatter chatter blah-blah, and me
swearing for all the time and money I'd wasted, and telling myself, I wanted 
to go west and here I'd been all day and into the night going up and down,
north and south, like something that can't get started. <P>
