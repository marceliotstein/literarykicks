	 Found this notice in Taugher Books page on the web:

			435. Kesey, Ken, Further Inquiry, NY: Viking 1990 Very fine, signed. Includes laid-in Herb 
Caen column about Kesey's bus. $50<P>

	Found this listing in Michigan State University's library:
		
			Totally Corrupt," sound recordings, Dial-A-Poem Poets, Giorno Poetry 			Systems 
Records, 1976.<P>

Also, I know of but can't find an interview with Tom Wolfe in a mid to 
late 1970s issue 
of Writer's Digest in which he talks about Kesey. What sticks in my mind about the 
interview is Wolfe talking about Kesey contemplating writing a book about a factory in 
which everybody died of silicosis and wanting to get a job there so he could experience 
what it was like!<P>
