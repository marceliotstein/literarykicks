	<p>As if three trips to New York and one to Torino weren&#8217;t enough, I just a few minutes ago arrived in Ripton, VT, where I have the honor of being able to participate in (and generally witness) the first ever Bread Loaf Translators&#8217; Conference. (A.K.A. Translation Loaf.) </p>

	<p>Since this was organized by Jen Grotz&#8212;our poetry editor, the translator of the forthcoming <i>Rochester Knockings</i>&#8212;I knew a bit about what was going to happen here, but now that I&#8217;m holding the full schedule in my hands . . . holy shit, guys. Holy. Shit. </p>

	<p>First off, tonight&#8217;s opening event features a reading by Maureen Freely, who will also be giving a talk on Wednesday entitled &#8220;Where I Go, When I Look Like I&#8217;m Translating a Book.&#8221; But then, tomorrow morning, Susan Bernofsky, hot off of winning the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize for her translation of Jenny Erpenbeck&#8217;s <em>The End of Days</em>, will talk about &#8220;Finding a Language for the Past.&#8221; Oh, and then, on Friday, <span class="caps">BTBA</span> winner Bill Johnston (I can&#8217;t even type his name without hearing the &#8220;<span class="caps">BILL</span>, billJOHNSTON, bill!&#8221; song that Kaija always sings for him) will be talking about &#8220;The Quest for a Voice: Translating Wieslaw Mysliwski&#8217;s <em>Stone upon Stone</em>.&#8221; Also, Michael Katz, translator of Dostoevsky and many other Russian greats, will give a lecture entitled &#8220;Translation Matters? Translation Matters. Translation Matters:.&#8221; </p>

	<p>These faculty members won&#8217;t just be giving speeches though, they&#8217;re also directing workshops each morning with seven or eight translators, going over their pre-submitted samples. (That&#8217;s some high quality pl√ºbbing!) Each of them will also be giving a reading of their own translations in the evening, and meeting with Loafers throughout the day. </p>

	<p>In addition to all of that, there are also four special panels and talks and classes for attendees, including one &#8220;On Publishing Literary Translations&#8221; where everyone can meet Jill Schoolman from Archipelago and Steve Woodward from Graywolf. Don Share is also teaching a class, as is Bill Johnston (one on &#8220;Translating Dialogue for the Stage&#8221;). </p>

	<p>And finally, I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on &#8220;Copyrights and Translation Contracts: What You Need to Know.&#8221; </p>

	<p>*</p>

	<p>Since this is incredibly important information for translators, and since I&#8217;m not a legal expert, I thought I would post an overview of what I plan on talking about, and if anyone has any specific bits of info that I should/shouldn&#8217;t include, please feel free to contact me. </p>

	<p>1) Before contacting a publisher with a sample of a book you want to translate, make sure the rights are available. You as the translator don&#8217;t have to &#8220;acquire&#8221; the rights&#8212;that&#8217;s something the publisher will do when/if they go ahead with the book&#8212;but you definitely need to make sure that no other publisher has already bought them. (And for your sake, it would be good to know that no one else is working on a translation.) </p>

	<p>2) When signing a contract, refer to the <a href="http://www.pen.org/model-contract-literary-translations"><span class="caps">PEN</span> Model Contract.</a> In addition to your fee&#8212;which is something I&#8217;ll probably spend most of my talk talking about, because that&#8217;s a really practical and pressing issue for a lot of translators&#8212;the other keys to pay attention to are: royalties on book sales and subrights, where your name will appear (or if it will at all), who has final approval of changes to the manuscript, whether the translation will be copyrighted in your name or not, and how the rights will be reverted when the book goes out of print. </p>

	<p>3) Over the past few months, copyrighting translation in the names of translators has been getting some attention on the social media platforms and whatnot, so it&#8217;s worth pointing out why this is important (and why publishers should allow the translations they publish to be copyrighted in the translator&#8217;s name). </p>

	<p>There are various legal arguments about copyright for translations&#8212;the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works establishes that translators are to be considered authors and should be treated as such&#8212;but I want to mostly look at the practical, publishing side of this. </p>

	<p>In terms of terminology, and since this comes up every so often, if you sign a contract in which the publisher takes away the translator&#8217;s copyright of the translation it&#8217;s a &#8220;work-for-hire contract.&#8221; Which, basically means what it says: the translator is being hired to do work for the publisher, after that work is completed and the translator is paid, the publisher owns the finished product and can do what it wants with it for the rest of the translation&#8217;s copyright. Nothing more is owed to the translator ever, and if the book goes out of print, the rights to the translation <em>do not</em> revert to the translator. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;m going to pause for one second and make clear that this doesn&#8217;t necessarily impact the amount that you are paid. A translator could sign a contract in which they retain the copyright to their translation (essentially, with <span class="caps">PEN</span>&#8217;s model contract, etc., the translator is &#8220;leasing&#8221; their intellectual property to the publisher to use for a specified period of time, such as, for as long as the book is in print) and receive a $100 advance against 25% of all net proceeds. Or, they could sign a work-for-hire contract and get paid a billion dollars. Or vice versa. These two things aren&#8217;t tied to one another. </p>

	<p>When copyright really becomes an issue is when the book goes out of print. This is usually due to the publisher losing the underlying rights. Just to back up to point one: A publisher doing a translation has a contract with the rights holder for the original work (the foreign publisher, the author, the author&#8217;s agent) and with the translator. The original contract may well specify that the publisher only has the rights to publish the book in print form for five years from the date of signing. Or it could state that the rights revert if the sales fall below 100 copies a year. Regardless, a lot of books end up going out-of-print at some point in time, either because the publisher runs out of copies and doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s financially worthwhile to print more, or because the agent (it&#8217;s always the agent, right?) takes them away after a particular period of time. </p>

	<p>If the translator signed a work-for-hire contract, and the book goes out of print, the rights to the translation remain with the publisher to reassign. So, let&#8217;s pretend that ten years down the road, a new start up press named Deep Letter Archive of Books wants to reissue a new edition of a supercool Thai book that changed the publisher&#8217;s life. First they have to acquire the underlying rights to the book, then the translation. This should be easy enough, unless, in the ensuing ten years, the original publisher went bankrupt (they <em>were</em> doing crazy experimental Thai books, so, you know, &#8220;limited upmarket potential&#8221; and all that), which means that the rights to translation are . . . where exactly? You have to contact how many lawyers? Ugh. That&#8217;s the moment I&#8217;d just say Fuck it and walk away.</p>

	<p>However, if the rights to the translation had reverted to the translator&#8212;just as the rights to the book itself had reverted to the author&#8212;then I could call up the translator (or his/her estate) and pay them a small sum ($500?) for the rights. And suddenly, this book would have another shot at finding an audience. </p>

	<p>Holding onto the translation rights&#8212;when you can&#8217;t hold on to the rights to the original book&#8212;seems baroque and silly to me. As a publisher you&#8217;re hoping for what? A $500 offer ten years down the road? At the expense of angering a group of already disenfranchised people?</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure some publishers have their reasons for doing business this way (the main argument being that they&#8217;re paying a lot for the creation of the translation so if there are future monies to be made, they deserve a cut), but it just doesn&#8217;t seem like something that should be a standard part of your business model, especially if you think about how much you really paid in comparison to the amount of time the translator spent working on this. Respect your translators! You wouldn&#8217;t pull this with an author . . . </p>

	<p>And I&#8217;m sure my presentation will have more jokes and asides and intricate points. But for now, I thought I&#8217;d at least share that. </p>

	<p>*</p>

	<p>More importantly: Don&#8217;t you wish you were on top of a Vermont mountain spending the week with all these great translators and translation publishers? </p>

	<p>Last summer, to coincide with the Real Life World Cup, we hosted the <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/?s=tag&amp;t=world-cup-of-literature">World Cup of Literature,</a> an incredible competition featuring 32 books from 32 countries, and ending with Roberto Bola√±o&#8217;s <em>By Night in Chile</em> (Chile) triumphing over Valeria Luiselli&#8217;s <em>Faces in the Crowd</em> (Mexico). It was glorious. </p>

	<p>Since the Women&#8217;s World Cup is kicking off in Canada next week, it&#8217;s time to do this all over again. Except that this time, only living <em>female</em> authors are allowed to participate. (And, as much as possible, the books included were published within the last ten years.) </p>

	<p>Before announcing the participating titles, I have to announce that we&#8217;re still looking for judges. And, unlike last year, we want at least two-thirds of the eighteen judges to be females. So, if you&#8217;re interested&#8212;as a judge you read two books, write up the result of that &#8220;match&#8221; complete with soccer-esque score, then chime in on the final&#8212;just email me at chad.post[at]rochester.edu. You&#8217;ll have to do this <em>fast</em> though. The competition launches next week . . . </p>

	<p>Tomorrow (or later today) we&#8217;ll post the new graphics and bracket so that you can see the first round competitions and debate which book has the easiest path to the final four, but for now, here&#8217;s a listing of all the titles that we&#8217;re including. (These are alphabetical in order of the country each is representing.)</p>

	<p>The eighth annual Best Translated Book Awards were announced at BookExpo America this afternoon, with <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300153323">Can Xue‚Äôs <em>The Last Lover</em>,</a> translated from the Chinese by Annelise Finegan Wasmoen, taking home the award for fiction, and <a href="http://www.phoneme.media/#!diorama/c1ryi">Roc√≠o Cer√≥n‚Äôs <em>Diorama</em>,</a> translated from the Spanish by Anna Rosenwong, winning in poetry. </p>

	<p>Thanks again to the support of Amazon.com‚Äôs giving programs, the winning authors and translators will each receive $5,000. </p>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11092.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="341" /></center></p>

	<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited,‚Äù Can Xue said when she was reached for a comment, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the most beautiful thing that has happened in my whole life. I always think of the <span class="caps">BTBA</span> as a very prestigious prize rewarding writers who have the great courage to achieve their literary ambitions.‚Äù</p>

	<p>According to the jury, Can Xue‚Äôs (‚Äútsan shway‚Äù) <em>The Last Lover</em> (published by Yale University Press) was the most radical and uncompromising of this year‚Äôs finalists, pushing the novel form into bold new territory. Journeying through a dreamworld as strange yet disquietingly familiar as Kafka‚Äôs <em>Amerika</em>, <em>The Last Lover</em> proves radiantly original. If Orientalists describe an East that exists only in the Western imagination, Can Xue describes its shadow, offering a beguiling dream of a Chinese West. Annelise Finegan Wasmoen‚Äôs translation succeeds in crafting a powerful English voice for a writer of singular imagination and insight.</p>

	<p>The judges also named three runners-up in fiction: <em>Harlequin‚Äôs Millions</em> by Bohumil Hrabal, translated from the Czech by Stacey Knecht and published by Archipelago Books, for the wonderful lyricism of its winding sentences; <em>Faces in the Crowd</em> by Valeria Luiselli, translated from the Spanish by Christina MacSweeney and published by Coffee House Press, for the exceptional promise it demonstrates as a debut novel; and <em>Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay</em> by Elena Ferrante, translated from the Italian by Ann Goldstein and published by Europa Editions, for its vibrant characters and sweeping narrative power.</p>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11102.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="315" /></center></p>

	<p>On the poetry side of things, David Shook, the co-founder and editorial director of Phoneme Media ‚Äúcongratulates translator Anna Rosenwong for her masterful translation of Roc√≠o Cer√≥n&#8217;s <em>Diorama</em>, our first book of poetry and one of the most fascinating and important books to have been published in Mexico this century. Phoneme Media is incredibly grateful for the support of the <span class="caps">BTBA</span>&#8217;s judges and organizers, to Three Percent and its indefatigable director Chad Post, to our fellow shortlisted publishing houses, translators, and authors, and to our readers around the world. Congratulations, Anna and Roc√≠o, on receiving this much deserved award!‚Äù </p>

	<p>Past winners of the fiction award include: <em>Seiobo There Below</em> and <em>Satantango</em>, both by L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai (recent recipient of the Man Booker International Prize) and translated from the Hungarian by Ottilie Mulzet and George Szirtes respectively; <em>Stone Upon Stone</em> by Wies≈Çaw My≈õliwski, translated from the Polish by Bill Johnston; and, <em>The True Deceiver</em> by Tove Jansson, translated from the Swedish by Thomas Teal. (Jansson and Teal are the only author and translator on this year‚Äôs fiction shortlist who have previously won the award.)</p>

	<p>In terms of the poetry award, past winners include: <em>The Guest in the Wood</em> by Elisa Biagini, translated from the Italian by Diana Thow, Sarah Stickney, and Eugene Ostashevsky; <em>Wheel with a Single Spoke</em> by Nichita StƒÉnescu, translated from the Romanian by Sean Cotter; and <em>Spectacle &amp; Pigsty</em> by Kiwao Nomura, translated from the Japanese by Kyoko Yoshida and Forrest Gander.  </p>

	<p>This year‚Äôs fiction jury is made up of: George Carroll, North-North-West and Shelf Awareness; Monica Carter, Salonica; James Crossley, Island Books; Scott Esposito, Conversational Reading and Center for the Art of Translation; Jeremy Garber, Powell&#8217;s Books; Katrine √ògaard Jensen, Asymptote; Madeleine LaRue, Music &amp; Literature; Daniel Medin, American University of Paris, Cahiers Series, Quarterly Conversation, and the White Review; and Michael Orthofer, Complete Review. </p>

	<p>The poetry jury includes: Biswamit Dwibedy, poet; Bill Martin, translator, critic, organizer of The Bridge; Dawn Lundy Martin, poet; Erica Mena, poet and translator; and Stefan Tobler, And Other Stories and translator.</p>

	<p>Following on my <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=14612">earlier post</a> about the &#8220;buzz&#8221; panel on general fiction in translation, here&#8217;s some info about the one that Tom Roberge will be moderating on Friday morning, which will be featuring all crime novels.</p>

	<p><b><span class="caps">BEA</span> Selects Crime Fiction in Translation</b><br />
<b>Fricay, May 28th, 10:30am</b><br />
<b>Eastside Stage</b></p>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11062.gif" alt="" width="220" height="342" /></center></p>

	<p><b>Europa Editions (Booth 3124)</b> will be presenting two titles, starting with Massimo Carlotto&#8217;s <a href="http://www.europaeditions.com/book.php?Id=310"><em>Gang of Lovers</em>,</a> translated from the Italian by Antony Shugaar:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Padua, Italy. An unremarkable man, a husband and father, disappears without a trace. After a few months of searching, the police send his file to the cold cases department to be thrown in with the files of other missing persons. One woman knows the truth about his disappearance, but, being the daughter of a prominent and wealthy Swiss industrialist she fears coming forward with what she knows: that she was his lover and that there is more to his disappearance than another bored suburban husband running out on his. Stricken by guilt, she finally confides in a lawyer who advises her to turn to Marco Buratti, aka The Alligator, for help. <br />
<br />
</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11072.png" alt="" width="220" height="342" /></center></p>

	<p>And, Michael Reynolds will also present Maurizio de Giovanni&#8217;s <a href="http://www.europaeditions.com/book.php?Id=318"><em>The Bottom of Your Heart</em>,</a> also translated from the Italian by Antony Shugaar:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In the middle of a summer heat wave, as Naples prepares for one of its most important holy days, a renowned surgeon falls to his death from his office window. For Commissario Ricciardi and Brigadier Maione it is the beginning of an investigation that will bring them into contact with the most torrid, conflicting, and enduring of human passions. In the world Ricciardi and Maione are about to enter, infidelity appears inextricable from the most joyful expressions of love, and, this interdependence sows doubt and uncertainty in both men, compromising their personal lives. </p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Europa Editions is celebrating their 10th Anniversary this year, starting with a party tonight at Greenlight Bookstore. I&#8217;m planning on going, and, as if it were still 2008, I&#8217;m going to try and do some crazy blogging about <span class="caps">BEA</span> when I get back. Stay tuned. <br />
<br />
</p>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11082.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="336" /></center></p>

	<p><b>Soho Press (Booth 3240)</b> will present <em>The Gun</em> by Fuminori Nakamura, translated from the Japanese by Allison Markin Powell:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>On a nighttime walk along a Tokyo riverbank, a young man named Nishikawa stumbles on a dead body, besides which is lying a gun. From the moment Nishikawa makes the decision to take the gun, the world around him blurs. Knowing he possesses the gun brings an intoxicating sense of purpose to his dull university life. But Nishikawa&#8217;s personal entanglements are becoming unexpectedly complicated: he finds himself romantically involved with two women, while his biological father, whom he&#8217;s never met, lies dying in a hospital. Through it all, he can&#8217;t stop thinking about the gun‚Äîand the four bullets preloaded in its chamber. As he spirals into obsession, his focus is consumed by one idea: that possessing the gun is no longer enough‚Äîhe must fire it.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Soho is one of the coolest presses publishing today. Great crime books, great literary fiction, great covers, great staff. </p>

	<p>Come out on Friday to see Tom host this panel with Michael Reynolds and Juliet Grames. </p>

	<p>So, this year, for the first time ever, BookExpo America is sponsoring two panels highlighting forthcoming works of fiction: one featuring general fiction, the other focusing on crime and thrillers. (Naturally, I&#8217;m moderating the first one and Tom Roberge is doing the other.) </p>

	<p>The one on general adult fiction will take place first on Thursday, May 28th, at 10:30am on the Eastside Stage. The Crime one will be on Friday, May 29th, at 10:30am on the Eastside Stage.</p>

	<p>Any of you who happen to be attending <span class="caps">BEA</span> should definitely come check this out. As a pilot program, it&#8217;s very important that we have a decent number of people show up for the events, so that we can hopefully grow this more and more in the future. </p>

	<p>To whet your interest, here&#8217;s a bit of a preview of the General Fiction panel (I&#8217;ll do crime separately), complete with booth numbers so that you can go snag galleys of the books that look most interesting to you:</p>

	<p><b><span class="caps">BEA</span> Selects Adult Fiction in Translation</b><br />
<b>Thursday, May 27th, 10:30am</b><br />
<b>Eastside Stage</b></p>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11042.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="324" /></center></p>

	<p><b>Coach House Books (Booth 648)</b> will present <em>Guano</em> by Louis Carmain, translated from the French by Rhonda Mullins.</p>

	<p>Since this won&#8217;t be available for a while, I can&#8217;t find any information about this on Coach House&#8217;s site, but I was able to scrape this off of Google Translate:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>This is a story of war and love. Now, as these two are often born of entertainment no &#8211; tense border, made smiles &#8211; to surprise us in the end to be all &#8211; dead, tears, surprises &#8211; there was virtually no grand departure thing.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Which . . . is intriguing . . . (Seriously though, Coach House does great work and I&#8217;m really glad they&#8217;ll be featured on this panel.) <br />
<br />
</p>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11032.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="330" /></center></p>

	<p><b>Coffee House Press (Booth 642)</b> will present Valeria Luiselli&#8217;s <a href="http://coffeehousepress.org/shop/the-story-of-my-teeth/"><em>The Story of My Teeth</em>,</a> translated from the Spanish by Christina MacSweeney:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Highway is a late-in-life world traveller, yarn spinner, collector, and legendary auctioneer. His most precious possessions are the teeth of the ‚Äònotorious infamous‚Äô like Plato, Petrarch, and Virginia Woolf. Written in collaboration with the workers at a Jumex juice factory, Teeth is an elegant, witty, exhilarating romp through the industrial suburbs of Mexico City and Luiselli‚Äôs own literary influences.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>(I actually just finished reading this and it&#8217;s wonderful.)<br />
<br />
</p>

	<p><center><img src="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/images/11052.png" alt="" width="220" height="329" /></center></p>

	<p><b>Graywolf Press (Booth 3064)</b> will present <a href="https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/woman-loved"><em>A Woman Loved</em></a> by Andre√Ø Makine, translated from the French by Geoffrey Strachan:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Catherine the Great‚Äôs life seems to have been made for the cinema‚Äîher rise to power, her reportedly countless love affairs and wild sexual escapades, the episodes of betrayal, revenge, and even murder‚Äîthere‚Äôs no shortage of historical drama. But Oleg Erdmann, a young Russian filmmaker, seeks to discover and portray Catherine‚Äôs essential, emotional truth, her real life, beyond the rumors and facades. His first screenplay just barely makes it past the Soviet film board, and is assigned to a talented director, but the resulting film fails to avoid the usual clich√©s. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as he struggles to find a place for himself in the new order, Oleg agrees to work with an old friend on a TV series that becomes a quick success‚Äîas well as increasingly lurid, a far cry from his original vision. He continues to seek the real Catherine elsewhere . . .</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Makine is extremely well-known throughout the world (you may be familiar with <em>Dreams of My Russian Summers</em>, which enjoyed a great deal of success) and it&#8217;s great that he&#8217;s found a home at Graywolf for his new books. </p>

	<p>Come out on Thursday morning to see Erin Kottke, Alana Wilcox, and Caroline Casey talk about all of these!</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=14572">latest addition</a> to our <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?s=reviews">Reviews</a> section is a piece by Vincent Francone on Milo≈° Djurdjeviƒá&#8217;s <em>Morse, My Deaf Friend</em>, translated by the author and published by Ugly Duckling Presse.</p>

	<p>The chapbook itself is short‚Äîclocking in at 32 pages‚Äîand is yet another beautiful work of print done by Ugly Duckling. Here&#8217;s the beginning of Vince&#8217;s review, which tries to get a grasp on what to expect, or not to expect, from poems labeled as &#8220;avant-garde&#8221;:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>There‚Äôs little to say about a series of prose poems that willfully refuse to identify pronoun antecedents. Or perhaps there are a million things. The poems in _Morse, My Deaf Friend_‚Äî the chapbook by Milo≈° Djurdjeviƒá published by Ugly Duckling Presse as part of their Eastern European Poets Series‚Äî will be confounding to those accustomed to poetry that holds its reader‚Äôs hand. These poems do not. They are elliptical and strange and offer very few concrete signifiers.</p>

	<p>Yesterday afternoon, as we were recording Three Percent podcast #99, it was announced that L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai had won the 2015 Man Book International Prize, becoming the only the sixth winner of the biennial award, and the first winner since Ismail Kadare in 2005 who doesn&#8217;t write in English. </p>

	<p>From the judges:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>In L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai‚Äôs <em>The Melancholy of Resistance</em>, a sinister circus has put a massive taxidermic specimen, a whole whale, Leviathan itself, on display in a country town. Violence soon erupts, and the book as a whole could be described as a vision, satirical and prophetic, of the dark historical province that goes by the name of Western Civilisation. Here, however, as throughout Krasznahorkai‚Äôs work, what strikes the reader above all are the extraordinary sentences, sentences of incredible length that go to incredible lengths, their tone switching from solemn to madcap to quizzical to desolate as they go their wayward way; epic sentences that, like a lint roll, pick up all sorts of odd and unexpected things as they accumulate inexorably into paragraphs that are as monumental as they are scabrous and musical.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And Marina Warner:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>L√°szl√≥ Krasznahorkai  is a visionary writer of extraordinary intensity and vocal range who captures the texture of present day existence in scenes that are terrifying, strange, appallingly comic, and often shatteringly beautiful. <em>The Melancholy of Resistance</em>, <em>Satantango</em> and <em>Seiobo There Below</em> are magnificent works of deep imagination and complex passions, in which the human comedy verges painfully onto transcendence. Krasznahorkai, who writes in Hungarian, has been superbly served by his translators, George Szirtes and Ottilie Mulzet.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>My favorite part of the <a href="http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/winner-2015-man-booker-international-prize">official press release</a> has to be this paragraph:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Krasznahorkai and his translator George Szirtes were longlisted for the 2013 Independent Foreign Fiction Prize for <em>Satantango</em> and Krasznahorkai has won the Best Translated Book Award in the US two years in a row, in 2013 for Satantango and in 2014 for <em>Seiobo There Below.</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Go <span class="caps">BTBA</span>! </p>

	<p>For winning the award, Krasznahorkai will receive ¬£60,000, and he &#8220;has chosen to split the ¬£15,000 translator‚Äôs prize between two translators, George Szirtes (who translated <em>Satantango</em> and <em>The Melancholy of Resistance</em>) and Ottilie Mulzet (who translated <em>Seiobo There Below</em>).&#8221;</p>
