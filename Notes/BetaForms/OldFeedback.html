"Shower a man with every earthly good.  Drown him in happiness over his head.
Give him such wealth that he'll have nothing to do but sleep and eat and busy
himself with assuring the continuance of world history.  And then, out of
sheer ingratitude, sheer nastiness, he will commit some vileness.  He'll even
risk his pastries, solely in order to inject his noxious fantastic element into
all that positive, sensible bliss, to confirm to himself that he is a man, and
not a piano key."
