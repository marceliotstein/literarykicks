Two times two equals four, even without my willing it.  Is this what
you call free will?  Two times two equals four ... it's an insufferable
thing!  In my opinion, it's pure insolence!  I agree that two times two
equals four is a splendid thing.  But if we're going to lavish praise,
then two times two equals five is sometimes also a charming little thing ..."

Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote "Notes From Underground" in 1864, in the 
middle of his highly dramatic life.  In the early 1840's he'd been a
literary sensation among Russia's liberal/radical intelligentsia,
but the shy young man was tormented by a social awkwardness that was 
probably more visible to him than to anybody else.  His confusing
early period ended when the government arrested him and several 
other young free-thinkers for alleged revolutionary activities.  The 
entire group was sentenced to death, and they were blindfolded and 
led out to the scene of their public execution before a message 
arrived from the Tsar announcing their last-minute reprieve.  One
of the other men was said to have gone insane during this ordeal,
whereas Dostoevsky endured it bravely.<P>

He spent four years in a miserable Siberian prison camp, and 
in 1859 returned home to St. Petersburg.  But Russia's most 
cultured city was in a prosperous, fashionably liberal 
mood, and the writer found himself 
unable to endure the vanity, false optimism and 
hypocrisy that now surrounded him.<P>

He wrote "Notes From Underground", a fiercely 
satirical short novel, composed entirely of the fictional
notes, confessions and rants left behind by a 
lonely St. Petersburg urbanite, a former 
middle-ranking civil servant in the Russian 
bureaucracy who now hid 
in the "underground" railing furiously 
against polite society while secretly yearning -- 
and comically failing -- to be accepted by it.  In
exquisitely self-contradictory language, rich with 
confusion and repressed emotion, Dostoevsky pinned his 
narrator to a board, a wriggling specimen
of humanity, like a butterfly on display.<P>

In October 1998, web designer and fiction writer 
<A HREF="../HomePages/LeviAsher.html">Levi Asher</A>
released an exciting new digital movie based on
the Dostoevsky novel, designed for viewing on a desktop computer 
(Windows or Mac) via CD-Rom.  Asher's version of 
"Notes From Underground" updates 
the setting to modern-day New York City, and features a 
sensitive performance by 
<A HREF="http://www.squidco.com">Phil Zampino</A> 
as the "Underground Man," a former middle-manager at a Wall 
Street bank who now wanders the streets of Manhattan looking
for trouble.<P>
