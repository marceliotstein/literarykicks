<STRONG>

I am a sick man.  A mean man.  An extremely unattractive man.<P>

I think I have some kind of liver illness.  Then again I don't know a thing 
about my illness.  I'm not even sure what hurts.<P>

I'm not being treated and never have been.  I do this out of spite.  Now 
this is probably something you won't understand.  Well, I do.  Of course 
I'm not exactly sure who will be hurt by my
spite in this case; I know perfectly well that I can't get even 
with doctors by refusing their treatment.  Ohh ... still I refuse
to be treated.  And still I do this out of spite!<P>

I used to work in the banking industry.  But no more.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>still images of him at work -- on phone, at fax 
machine, etc.</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

I was a nasty businessman.  I was rude to co-workers and clients, 
and I took pleasure in it.  After all, since I didn't get rich, 
at least I had to reward myself in some way.  (That's not a 
very good joke.  I said it hoping I'd
sound very witty, but I suppose I was only trying to show off.
Not that I regret having tried -- given another chance, I would
say it again!)<P>

But the most disgusting thing is: all those years, I was shamefully 
aware at every moment, even at the moment of my greatest bitterness, 
that I was not actually a spiteful man.  I was not even a bitter
man.  I was merely scaring sparrows to no effect, and consoling
myself by doing so.  I would foam at the mouth!  But just bring
me some toy to play with ... just serve me a nice cup of tea
with sugar, and I would probably have calmed down. <P>

You probably think that I want to amuse you.  You're wrong about 
that too.  I'm not at all the cheerful fellow that I seem to be.  
Ohh ... I'm told that the climate in this city is not good for my
health.  I remain here.  I shall not leave my city!  Oh, what
difference does it make to you whether I leave this city or
not?<P>

Now ... what is it that a decent man can talk about with the
greatest pleasure?   <P>

Answer: about himself.  Well, then, I will talk about myself.<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>TWO: THE INSULT</CENTER><HR><HR><P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>images of the sidewalk in front of an east village bar.  narrator
enters.</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

There's a dive on my street, where one night I saw
a fight and watched as a man was bodily thrown out the
door onto the sidewalk.  I watched, and I was suddenly overcome with
envy of the man who had been thrown out, an envy so acute that
I even stepped into the bar.  Perhaps I too could get into a fight
and get tossed out the door.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>he talks to camera, calmly, frankly</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

I wasn't drunk -- well, there you have it! -- that's what loneliness
can drive a man to.  But it came to nothing.  It turned out that
I wasn't even capable of getting thrown out the door.  I was put in
my place immediately by a neighbor.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>we see businessman arrogantly standing on subway train, and
walking up subway platform stairs</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

I recognized him from the 6 train.  He also worked on Wall Street, and we'd 
often find ourselves emerging from the subway together in the morning.  
He had a longer ride than me, though, as I lived on
the Lower East Side and he -- I imagined, based on his expensive clothing
and superior attitude -- lived on the Upper East Side.  In any case, he was
always on the train before me.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>we see the businessman at pool table in the bar, taking shots.  
we follow the action as it is described by the narrator</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

I was surprised and pleased to see him in this bar, and I approached the
pool table where he was engaged in a game, planning to strike up a 
conversation and perhaps begin the fight I was so eager to start.  I happened 
to step into his way, and he reached and arm out and silently, without
warning and without apology, shoved me to one side.  
He then walked by as if he had never noticed me.  I 
could have forgiven a punch, but how could I forgive being just
moved aside like that! And being so completely ignored!<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>talking to camera again -- indignant, heating up</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

What I wouldn't have done at that moment for a <I>real</I>
fight.  But I'd been treated as if I were a fly.  Now it was my turn: I 
only had to protest, and then there would have been a fight, 
and I would have been thrown out the door.  But I changed my
mind and chose to ... slink out of the bar!  Fuming with bitterness!<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>at home at night, in living room banging a can of beer, 
cursing himself.  cuts to walking confusedly, haphazardly on street,
in and out of stores</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

I returned home, confused and overwrought.  And 
on the following night I went on with my little dissipations still
more timidly, more furtively and sadly than before -- as though
with tears in my eyes.  Yet I went on. 
 
</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>talking to camera</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

But don't think I 
retreated before the businessman out of cowardice: I have
never been a coward at heart!  Although I was forever fearful of 
action.  But rest before you laugh -- I would like to explain 
this.  Rest assured, I have explanations for everything.<P>

You see, I slunk out not because of cowardice, but because of boundless
vanity.  What frightened me was not the man's size or the 
painful thrashing I might get.  I would have had sufficient
physical courage!  But <I>I lacked moral courage</I>.  I was afraid that 
if I protested everybody present -- everybody -- would misunderstand
and laugh at me.  I was absolutely certain that all of them would
simply split their sides with laughter.  And the businessman, 
instead of giving me a simple and therefore inoffensive thrashing, 
would have kicked me with his knee and driven me in this manner
all the way around the billiard table.  And only <I>then</I> might he
take mercy on me and throw me out onto the sidewalk.<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>THREE: SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL</CENTER><HR><HR><P>


</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>walking in a museum, confused, looking at paintings.  soho art
galleries, the moma, the met, etc.  he walks aimlessly, watching people eating in 
restaurants, shopping in fashionable stores.</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

I wish I were only a selfish and lazy man.  Lord, how I'd respect myself then.<P>

If only I were capable of laziness.  That would mean I would have an actual 
discernible quality.  Question: who are you?  Answer: a lazy man.  It would
be a pleasure to hear this about myself.<P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>we see a well-dressed person pontificating about a cigar</CENTER>
</I><P>
<STRONG>

I once worked with a man who prided himself on being a conniseur of fine Cuban
cigars, which he traded and discussed with other cigar aficianados.  He regarded this
as a most positive virtue and never doubted himself.<P>

I wish I could be a glutton.  I 
would be not an ordinary glutton, but one exquisitely attuned to the grand and
sublime and beautiful.  Oh!  I've dreamed of this for a long time.  I would turn
everything in the world into the sublime and beautiful.  <P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>flashes of ugly scenes along with the abstract beauty.  music 
gradually screeches to a halt.</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

In the vilest and most arrant rubbish I would manage to discern the sublime and 
beautiful.  And I'd demand to be respected for this.  I'd live serenely and die
with solemn dignity.  But this is delightful, truly delightful!  I would grow such
a belly.  I'd contrive for myself such a triple chin and such a scarlet nose that 
everybody I met would say, on seeing me: "That is somebody!  That's somebody
truly worthy and positive!"<P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>bitterly -- as we fixate on an ugly scene of urban reality --
garbage and homeless people on a streetcorner</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

Say what you will, sirs!  But it's most pleasant to hear such comments in our <I>negative
age.</I>.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>transition -- white light.  we hear an odd, disembodied voice</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

There are times in my life when I simply suffocate with anger.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>central park, watching people walk and rollerblade, watching
children in playground.  sits on rock, looks at fifth avenue skyline.</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

And who was the first to proclaim that man does vile things only because he does 
not realize his true interests?  That if man were enlightened, if his eyes were
opened to his true, normal interests, he would immediately cease committing
abominations and become completely good and noble?  Oh, child.  Oh,  pure, 
innocent babe.<P>

You see, in calculating man's advantages, all these statisticians and sages and
humanitarians omit one of them.  This particular advantage doesn't fit into their
categories or schemes.<P>

Shower a man with every earthly good, drown him in happiness over his head, 
so that only bubbles will spring up on the surface of this happiness, as on water.
Give him such wealth that he'll have nothing to do but sleep and eat and busy 
himself with assuring the continuance of world history.  And then, out of 
sheer ingratitude, sheer nastiness, he will commit some vileness.  He'll even
risk his pastries, solely in order to inject his noxious fantastic element into
all that positive, sensible bliss, to confirm to himself that he is a man, and
not a piano key.  <P>

I am told: two times two equals four.  But this is not life,
but the beginning of death. Two times two will be
four even without my willing it.  Is this what you call free 
choice?  Two times two equals four ... it's an insufferable 
thing!  In my opinion, it's pure insolence! Two times two 
equals four stands there brazenly with its hands
on its hips, blocking your path and spitting in your face.  I
agree that two times two equals four is a splendid thing.  But
if we're going to lavish praise, then two times two equals five
is sometimes also a charming little thing.<P>

But why?  Why do we passionately love destruction and chaos?  Tell me!  I
want to know.  Is it because we are afraid of acheiving our goals, afraid of
completing the edifice we are creating? <P>

Oh, why was I endowed with such desires?  Was I made this way simply so
that I'd come to the conclusion that my whole way of being is a fraud?  Is this
the sole purpose?  I don't believe it.<P>

But do you know what?  I am convinced that we underground men must be kept well
reined in.  A man like me may be capable of sitting in his hole for forty years without 
a word, but once he comes outside and breaks into speech, he will talk and talk and
talk ...<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>FOUR: THE DUEL</CENTER><HR><HR><P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>we see the scene as it happens, the narrator glaring
at the businessman at a wall street lunch stands.  music 
becomes ominous and scary.</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

I would see the businessman buying falafel at lunchtime.  Or he'd be on
the 6 train sitting down right in front of me. Sometimes at lunchtime
I'd see him walking with other well-dressed jolly high-powered traders, 
in their suspenders and Brooks Brothers suits.  <P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>crazily</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

I finally decided I had to challenge him to a duel.<P>

You see, he had this way of walking.  He would step aside before executives or
attractive women or even his own peers.  But people like me, people a rung or
two below his rank, he simply crushed.  He walked right at them, as if there were
but empty space before him.<P>

It tormented me that even in the street I couldn't manage to treat him as an equal. <P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>we see him contemplating this wildly in bed at night, an almost
comically inquisitive, confused look on his face.</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

"Why must you step aside first?"  I'd rant at myself in wild hysterics, sometimes 
waking up at three in the morning.  "Why always you, why not he?  Why can't
it be on equal terms, as always when well-bred people meet.  If I only yield half,
he will yield half --and we may even glance at each other with a look of mutual
respect!<P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>back to the sidewalks, we see the businessman again</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

But this never happened, and I continued to flinch away.  He meanwhile, didn't
even notice that I was there yielding him the right of way.  I finally made up my
mind about it.  I would not step aside -- even if it means smashing into him, I would
not step aside.  My decision was made.  However, preparations took a long time.
The first problem was my suit.  I owned no suit to compare with even the worst
piece of his wardrobe; even his casual wear on Fridays was more impressive than
my most expensive suit.<P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>stealth shots of Brooks Brothers and Barney's New
York.</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

I did not have the money to buy the kind of suit I needed, so I took out a small
bank loan and went to Brooks Brothers.  But nothing there struck the particular
right note, though the price tags were frightening, and I went to Barney's New
York and found a beautiful, stunning suit that was shamefully, sinfully expensive.  I could
have bought two Brooks Brothers suits and a pair of shoes for the price of this
suit.  Now I was in an excited state. <P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>thrashing now in bed, a look of utter fear transforms into a burst 
of joyous intoxicated hope and wonder.</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

At night I couldn't sleep; I suffered from fever.
I would rehearse my scene -- my heart would sink with fear, as if about to stop, then
suddenly begin to thump and thump!<P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>back to wall street, newsstands, subways.</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

But for all my preparations, all my firm resolve, I could not hold my ground when
I saw him approaching.  Not even in my best suit.  One day I was fully set to do it,
but all that happened was I stumbled underfoot, because at the very last moment,
just two inches away from him, I lost courage.  He very calmly stepped across
me, and I bounced aside like a rubber ball.  That night I was sick again, feverish
and delirious.<P>

Then suddenly everything came to a miraculous conclusion.  The next day I made
a final decision to abandon my ruinous plan, to dismiss it all.  With that in mind, I
wore my suit to work again the next day, simply to symbolize that I would dismiss it
all.  As I was walking down the street pondering this, I suddenly saw him coming --
I looked up and saw I was three steps from my enemy!  I made up my mind in an
instant, shut my eyes and froze -- and we collided firmly.  <P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>musically and visually, an abstract "bump".</CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

Shoulder against shoulder!  I did not yield an inch! <P>

</STRONG>
<I><CENTER>back to sidewalk, he's happy.  the businessman walks away down the street. </CENTER></I><P>
<STRONG>

I passed him by entirely on an equal footing.
He did not even glance back and pretended he hadn't noticed anything, but he was
only pretending.  I am convinced of that.  To this day, I am convinced of that.<P>

I had acheived my goal, I had saved my dignity.  That night I was jubilant.<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>FIVE: MEMORIES</CENTER><HR><HR><P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>we are in a subway tunnel, hearing music, as the train pulls
into a station.  fade to narrator speaking to camera, in gentle confidence now, 
sadly and honestly</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

In everybody's mind there are things he won't reveal to others.  Except perhaps
to friends.  And there are things he won't reveal to friends but only to himself, and
then in secret.  And then there are things he is afraid to reveal even to himself.  And
every decent man has quite an accumulation of these things.<P>

I have only recently gotten up the courage to recall some of my former adventures,
memories which I have until now only skirted.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>a window on a snowy day</I></CENTER><P>
<STRONG>

Today I am particularly oppressed by a certain memory of long ago.  It came
to my mind so vividly the other day ... and then it stayed with me like an annoying
tune that won't leave you alone.  And yet you must get rid of it.  I have hundreds of
such memories, but at times one will leap out and oppress me.  <P>

It's snowing, an almost wet snow.  Yesterday it snowed too, and the day before.
I think it is the wet snow that recalled to me the incident that now refuses to let 
me rest.  And so let this be a tale apropos of the wet snow.<P>

</STRONG>
<CENTER><I>fade out, end of part one</I></CENTER><P>
