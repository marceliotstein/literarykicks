<H4>Shower a man with every earthly good, drown him in 
happiness over his head... give him such wealth that

nastiness, he will commit some vileness.  He'll even 
risk his pastries, solely in order to inject his 
noxious fantastic element into all that positive, 
sensible bliss, to confirm to himself that he is a 
man, and not a piano key.</H4>
