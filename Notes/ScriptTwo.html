<CENTER><I>title: "Apropos of Wet Snow."  Shot of snowy evening 
through window.  Poem by Nekrasov scrolls on screen, 
verbatim from the book.  The following voice-over is illustrated
by slow-moving, dreamy animated snow-images.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

It happened when I was twenty-four years old.<P>

My life was already then gloomy, disorderly and wildly solitary.  At the bank 
I did not associate with anyone, avoiding even conversations, and retreated more
and more into my corner.  I was aware that my co-workers not only considered
me an eccentric but also, I felt, regarded me with a kind of loathing.  Sometimes
I wondered: why didn't anyone else worry about being loathed?  Why was I the
only one concerned with this?  One of my co-workers had a horribly pock-marked
face -- another one rarely showered and walked around emitting a repulsive smell.  
Yet neither of them showed any embarrasment.  Neither seemed to imagine that
he was regarded with loathing -- and even if they had imagined it, they 
wouldn't have cared, as long as it wasn't their superiors who viewed them in
this manner.<P>

I hated my face.  I thought it was revolting and even suspected that
it bore a nasty, abject expression; therefore every time I came to work I painfully
tried to carry myself as independently as possible and to assume the noblest air, so
that no one would suspect me of nastiness.  It may not be a handsome face, I thought,
but let it be nobly expressive and, above all, <I>extremely</I> intelligent.  Yet
I knew with agonizing certainty that my face would never express all these 
perfections.  It was a positively <I>stupid</I> face. <P>

Naturally I hated all my co-workers.  Yet I seemed to fear them too.  I was 
terrified of looking ridiculous and therefore slavishly worshipped established
conventional behavior.  I set myself into the general groove, and dreaded the
slightest sign of any eccentricity within me.<P>

My chief occupation at home was reading.  I sought to drown all that was 
continually seething within me by this activity.  It helped a great deal;
books stirred, delighted and tormented me.  But at times I'd get terribly
sick of them.  I longed to move about, because I was such a terrible
dreamer.  In my dreams, I'd suddenly become a heroic figure.  There were 
moments of such absolute rapture, such happiness, that I did not feel the
slightest trace of mockery within me -- I swear I didn't.  I felt
only faith, hope and love.  And that is just the point: at these moments I had
a blind belief that, by some miracle, through some external circumstance, 
everything would suddenly expand, enlarge itself, and I would suddenly
come forth into God's world.  All but riding a white horse, and crowned with
laurel.<P>

In my dreams I could not conceive of a secondary role, and that was
precisely why in reality I very calmly occupied the lowest.  Either a hero
or mud!  There was no middle.  In fact this is what ruined me, because,
mired down in filth, I would console myself with the thought that at other
times I was a hero, and the hero redeemed the filth.  As if to say: it would
be shameful for an ordinary man to get mired down, but a hero is too lofty
to be completely defiled, hence he could wallow in filth.<P>

Oh, but then I would triumph over everybody.  Naturally they would all be
prostrate in the dust and compelled to voluntarily recognize my perfections, 
while I forgave them all.  Or else I was a famous poet and fell in love.  I
earned millions and millions of dollars and immediately gave it all away
for the benefit of humanity, at the same moment confessing before the
crowd all my infamies, which of course, were not <I>actual</I> infamies
but rather contained within themselves a wealth of "the sublime and the
beautiful."  Everyone would weep and kiss me, then a march would
strike up, and the poor would be fed and the world would declare itself
at peace -- and a huge ball would be given in my honor on the shore
of Lake Como, and there would be a scene in the shrubbery, and so on,
and so forth -- don't you know it all?<P>

You will say that it is cheap for me to confess all this banality.  But 
is it?  Do you really think I am ashamed of it?  Or that it is any sillier 
than anything in your own lives?  <P>

Besides, believe me ... some of it was rather nicely composed.  After all,
not everything took place on the shore of Lake Como.  However, you are 
right: it's really cheap and banal.  And the worst of it is that I have begun
to justify myself before you.  And even worse, that I am now making <I>this</I>
remark.  But enough, or there will be no end to it.  Whatever I say or do
now will be cheaper and nastier than what has gone before.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>repeat of the opening theme from Enesco.  We fade in on
the narrator dreaming on a sofa in a quiet room, smiling slightly.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

These surges of "the sublime and the beautiful" would come upon me just when I
was at my lowest depths.  They came in spurts, as if to remind me of
themselves.  Oh ... how much love I experienced in these dreams of mine.
This love might have existed only in fantasy, it might never have been 
applied to any human reality.  It was so abundant, so overflowing, that
afterwards there wasn't even any need to apply it in practice.  That
would have been too much of a luxury.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>we see a book, held open on the narrator's lap.</I>
</CENTER><STRONG><P>

But, with all the reading and the dreaming, I would find myself
overwhelmed with pent-up misery.  I would
hysterically long for contradictions, contrasts.  I longed to move about,
and this is when I would plunge into dark, surreptitious, sordid debauchery.  
Not even debauchery ... but mean, paltry dissipation.<P>

You see, I was never able to dream consistenly for more than three months.  
After this amount of time my dream phase would have reached such a 
degree of happiness that I would feel an overwhelming need to embrace all
people, all mankind, immediately, at once.  And that required the 
presence of at least one person existing in reality.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>we see pictures of Stephen.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

So I would plunge forth into society.  There were a few co-workers I had
a chance of socializing with.  And there were some former college friends
who lived or worked nearby.  One was an acquaintance named Stephen.  In 
college he'd been a quiet and 
even-tempered person.  He hadn't distinguished himself in any way, but
I discerned in him a certain independence of character, and even honesty.
We'd had some bright moments together in our college days, but they
did not last: somehow they clouded over suddenly.  He evidently found
these recollections irksome and, I think, feared that I might fall back
into the former tone.  I suspected that he felt extreme aversion to me,
yet I continued to visit him, not quite <I>certain</I> that it was so.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>during the following scenes, the pictures follow the action --
first walking up an apartment staircase, then entering the room and
encountering the three friends.  We do not see the narrator, but rather
see the action from his point of view.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

One day, unable to endure my solitude any longer, I decided to visit Stephen.  
As I climbed the stairs, I remember thinking that I should not be going
there, as he found my presence irksome.  Such thoughts always in the
end goad me irresistibly, as though in spite, into extremely dubious 
situations.<P>

I found two other former college acquaintances with him.  They seemed
to be discussing an important matter and paid scarcely any attention
to my entrance, which was rather odd, as I had not seen them for many
years.  They obviously regarded me as no more than an ordinary fly.  
I had not been subjected to such slights even at school.  Stephen seemed
surprised to see me -- but then, my visits always seemed to surprise him.<P>

They were discussing a farewell dinner they were arranging for the following
night.  This was to honor another person we'd all known in college, Zorko, who
was already at this young age a Vice-President of his bank, and who
was now being assigned to a prestigious position in England.  I had 
always hated Zorko.  He hadn't been an impressive student, but upon 
graduation had landed a wonderful job due to some family connections.  He
was an extremely vulgar fellow, though good-hearted.  I hated his 
handsome but foolish face, and his endless boasting of successes with
women.  I remember him bragging one day of an amorous conquest that, to 
my hearing, nearly verged on date rape -- and I could not stand it and
lashed into him in front of a large crowd.  I got the better of him that
time.  But Zorko, though stupid, was always cheerful, and therefore laughed
my accusations off, and the crowd applauded him and I suppose
I did not actually altogether get the better of him that time.<P>

When we ran into each other after college he made an effort to be friendlier
to me, and I was not too unreceptive, because it flattered me.  But we
quickly and naturally drifted apart.<P>

Now here I was with Stephen, and Freddy, and Thomas, and they were planning
a dinner for Zorko.  "Well," said Thomas, "at 125 dollars each, that's 375
for the three of us, we can have a good dinner.  Of course we won't ask 
Zorko to pay."<P>

"Naturally," said Freddy, "since he's the guest of honor."<P>

"Okay, then," Stephen said, "375 should cover the four of us at the Hotel
de Paris."<P>

"But why only 375?" I asked.  "Counting me, it'll will be 500 dollars."<P>

It seemed to me that this sudden and unexpected offer to join in would be
a handsome gesture and would win them over and raise me in their estimation.<P>

"Oh, you wish to come too?" Stephen asked with displeasure, somehow trying to
avoid my eyes.  He knew me through and through.<P>

It infuriated me that he knew me through and through.<P>

"But why?" I said.  "I'm also an old schoolmate, and frankly, I resent 
being left out."<P>

"And where were we supposed to look for you?" asked Freddy rudely.<P>

"You were never on good terms with Zorko," said Thomas.<P>

"It seems to me that no one has a right to judge that," I argued in a 
trembling voice.  "Perhaps that's why I want to come now, because we
were not on good terms."<P>

"Oh well," Thomas said.  "Who could ever figure you out, all those
high-flown notions ..."<P>

"Fine," Stephen said impatiently.  "Tomorrow at seven, at the Hotel de 
Paris."<P>

"And what about the money?" Freddy said with a snicker, and
I flushed with embarrassment, because I suddenly remembered that I still
owed Stephen two hundred dollars from the last time we had seen each other
almost a year before, and now I realized he'd not only remembered 
this but had spoken of it to his friends.<P>

I was flustered by this but thankfully the party broke up immediately
at this moment, and I found myself on the street again, muttering to
myself -- what had just happened?  I was in a rage.  What had gotten
into me?  Of course, I knew, I shouldn't go.  But I was in a rage 
precisely because I knew I would go, just out of spite.<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>TWO: DINNER SCENE</CENTER><HR><HR><P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>the scene is acted out at a restaurant</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

The next morning I roused myself early and leaped out of bed, as excited as if 
everything was to start happening all at once.  I felt I was on the verge of
a radical change in my life, at that the change would come this very day.<P>

I went to work as usual, but slipped away two hours earlier in order to 
prepare myself.  The main thing, I felt, was not to be the first to come, or 
they would think I was much too overjoyed at the occasion.  But there were
thousands of such "main things," and they all agitated me to the point of 
exhaustion.<P>

I stopped at the bank and withdrew my last two hundred dollars, knowing even
as I did it that a crisis would ensue now when it came time to pay my rent, and
that I would need to find somebody else to borrow from when that time came.  
As I shaved and dressed for the evening, fretting over my inferior clothes, I
knew I was getting in over my head, that I should not be going.  But that
was impossible, once I was drawn to anything I'd plunge all the way in.  
Otherwise I'd have jeered at myself for backing out.  I passionately longed
to prove that I was not a coward.  But there was more: in the most violent
paroxysm of cowardly fever, I dreamed of winning the upper hand, of conquering,
of making them love me.  They would abandon Zorko, amazed at my noble mind 
and superior wit.  He would sit at the side, silent and shamed, and I would
crush him.  Afterwards I would perhaps make peace with him, and drink to
our <I>friendship.</I><P>

Oh ... how I prayed to God for the day to be over!  With inexpressible 
anguish I kept going to the window and peering out at the grayish murk
of densely falling wet snow.  At last, my broken-down old wall clock 
wheezed out the hour of seven.  I crept out my door and hailed a taxi,
planning to drive up to the restaurant in high fashion.<P>

I knew in advance that I would be the first.  But not only did I find
no one there, but the maitre'd could not find the reservation at all.  
He seated me with a conceited air of dismissal as he and an assistant
endeavored to sort out the misunderstanding.  Only after I'd been seated,
lonely and ridiculous, at a table for five, did they discover that the
reservation had been recently changed for an hour later, without my
being informed.<P>

I sat for a furious hour, humiliated as the waiters sailed past me.  When
the party appeared at eight, all together, I was even for a moment overjoyed
to see them, so desparate had I become after sitting at the table for an
hour.  But of course it was necessary that I appear offended.<P>

Zorko approached me first.   He and the others were laughing.  Seeing me,
he drew himself up, bowing slightly, almost coquettishly, at the waist, 
and offered me his hand, amiably enough but not overly so, with a 
certain careful civility, for all the world like a general or a 
dignitary greeting a petitioner.  As if, offering his hand, he was also
guarding himself against something.<P>

I had never experienced such condescension, such conceited phony benevolence.
So he was no entirely convinced of his immeasurable superiority over me
in all respects!  He had really taken it into his sheep's brain that he
could no longer regard me in any way but patronizingly!  The realization
made me gasp for air.<P>

"I was astonished to learn of your desire to join us," he began, simpering
and lisping and stretching out his words, which he had never done in the past.
"We've <I>somehow</I> gotten out of contact.  A pity.  We aren't as dreadful
as you think.  At any rate, I am pleased to renew ..." and he allowed his words 
to trail off in mid-sentence, disinterestedly, as he unbuttoned his coat.<P>

"Have you been waiting long?" asked Thomas.<P>

"I came exactly at seven, as I was told to yesterday," I answered loudly.<P>

"Ahh, didn't you let him know the hour was changed?" Thomas asked Stephen.<P>

"I didn't.  I forgot," Stephen answered, without any sign of regret, and he
sat down and began to study the wine list.<P>

"So you've been waiting an hour, you poor fellow!" Zorko exclaimed mockingly.
Freddy echoed his mocking tone with a vile, high-pitched titter, sounding for
all the world like the yipping of a nasty pup.<P>

"It's not the least bit amusing!" I cried to Freddy.  "It's someone else's 
fault, not mine!  No one took the trouble to let me know.  It's -- preposterous."<P>

Stephen defended himself rudely.  "I didn't know your address.  How was I to
find you?"  He avoided my eyes.  It was obvious he had something against me,
that I was the victim of his trick.   This was obvious not only to me, but
to all.<P>

Zorko attempted to strike up a conversation with me.  He asked about the bank
I worked at, and inquired as to my position.  He seemed to pity me in my
embarrassment, and felt I needed befriending.  <I>Does he want me to throw
a bottle at him?</I> I raged within myself.<P>

Upon learning that I worked in the Domestic Custody department at my bank, 
he asked why I had transferred from Global Markets, where I'd originally
been employed.  "The reason I decided to transfer," I said, "is that I 
decided to transfer."  Freddy snorted at this.  Stephen gave me an 
ironic look.  Thomas stopped eating and began to study me with
curiousity.  <P>

If Zorko was offended, he did not show it.  He asked about my salary.  Of
course, gentleman never discuss salary with each other, and the proper
response was for me to take even more offense at his presumption, but instead,
inexplicably blurted out the amount of money I earned a year, which the 
four of them all began to wonder at.<P>

"Not much," Zorko remarked with an air of self-importance.<P>

"I don't see how you can be dining at the Hotel de Paris on that!" Freddy
exclaimed.<P>

"I think it's simply a pittance," Thomas added.<P>

"Oh, let's stop embarassing him," Freddy cried, snickering.<P>

I exploded.  "My dear sirs!  I'll have you know that I am not embarassed!  I
am dining at this restaurant at my own expense, not someone else's!"  I 
suppose this was some attempt to gain ground upon the fact that Zorko's
dinner was our mutual gift, but it was an ill-concieved remark and landed
with no effect except that of confusion.<P>

"What do you mean?" Freddy demanded, as if thinking I were directing my
insult at him.  

"I mean just that," I said.  "And I think it might be better for us to
turn to a more intelligent topic of conversation now?"<P>

"You intend to demonstrate your intellect?" Freddy said. <P>

"Don't worry," I said.  "That would be quite superflous here.<P>

"Enough, gentlemen, enough," Zorko said with a masterful air.<P>

"How stupid!" Stephen muttered in agreement.<P>

"Really stupid," Thomas said, addressing himself solely to me.  "We've
come together here to send our good friend off to England, not to 
fight.  Last night you forced yourself upon us.  Well, then, stop
disrupting the general harmony ..."<P>

"Enough of this, enough," Zorko shouted.  "Let's just stop it.  Better
I should tell you about how I almost got married the other day."<P>

And he launched into a most unsavory anecdote, in which there was not 
a word about marriage, but it was peppered with the names of Vice-Presidents,
important government dignitaries, even movie stars, all of them, allegedly,
now members of Zorko's new social circle.  His college friends listened 
with delight, laughing shriekingly.  I sat ignored by everyone, crushed 
and annihilated.<P>

I thought: what am I doing here?  I must get up and leave at once.  Simply
leave without a word, to show my contempt.  I should have.  I could have
slammed my hundred and twenty-five dollars on the table and walked away
in a last gasp of glory.  But I did not.  I stayed.<P>

In my misery, I drank wine by the glassful.  Being unaccustomed to alcohol,
I began to get drunk, and the more drunk I became the more resentful I became. 
I arrogantly turned my glazing eyes from one of them to the other, but
they seemed to have forgotten me entirely.  Zorko was now telling another
story, in which a famous young member of a princely American family had
personally arranged a rendezvous between Zorko and a certain fashion model,
who Zorko then proceeded to take advantage of most shamefully.  At this
I broke in, remarking that neither of these celebrities, apparently, 
had bothered to join the party this evening.<P>

For a moment everybody fell silent.<P>

"You are already drunk," Thomas finally said.  Zorko stared at me as if
I were a gnat.  I dropped my eyes.  Stephen endeavored to distract the
group by pouring a toast to their honored guest.  Everybody raised their
glasses, everybody but me.<P>

"To your health, my friend Zork, and to old friendships, and 
to all of our future pleasures!" Thomas exclaimed.  
They all drank and cheered. 
I did not stir.  The glass stood untouched before me.<P>

"Aren't you drinking?" Thomas asked angrily.<P>

"I want to make my own speech," I said.  "Then I will drink."<P>

"Nasty little bastard," I heard Freddy say.<P>

I stood up in my chair and feverishly lifted my glass, preparing myself
for something extraordinary, though I did not know what.<P>

"Silence!" Freddy shouted.  "Now, for a show of intelligence!"<P>

They all sat waiting.  This was my moment.<P>

"Mr. Zorko," I said.  "I want you to know that I detest wise-cracking
self-proud name-dropping phony gentlemen like yourself.  You are no
more a gentleman than I am, you are just as much a fool ... and yet I 
see that recently you have taken on incredible airs.  That is the 
first point in its entirety.  Now on to the second ..."<P>

I didn't know what I was saying.  I continued.  "Point number two!  I
hate smut, and I hate people who relish smut.  Particularly the 
latter!"<P>

"Point number three!  I love truth, sincerity and honesty."  I went
on almost automatically, for I was turning cold with horror myself,
unable to understand how I could say such things.  "I love ideas,
Mr. Zorko; I love true friendship, on an equal footing, and not ...
uhh ... I love ... well, after all, why not?  I drink to your
health too, Mr. Zorko.  Go on, seduce fashion models, be a 
smashing success on the London social circuit ... and ... your
health, Mr. Zorko!"<P>

Zorko rose from his chair, bowed to me and said: "I am most
grateful to you."<P>

He was terribly offended and had turned pale.<P>

"I'll fucking smash his face in," Thomas said, his fists
clenched, at the table.<P>

"I'll do it myself right now," Freddy exclaimed.<P>

"Just throw the idiot out the door," Stephen muttered 
to the table.<P>

"Not a word, gentlemen, not a word!" Zorko said solemnly.  "I
thank you all, but I'm perfectly capable of showing him myself
how much value I attach to his words."<P>

"Freddy!"  I shouted.  "I will have it out with you before the 
night is over."<P>

"A fight?" Freddy said, licking his lips.  "I'm ready."  But I must
have seemed such a ridiculous challenger, with my small and weak
frame, that the mood of the moment changed and all present exploded
with laughter at the idea of me fighting Freddy, and I knew I would
not get this satisfaction.<P>

"He's just a drunk asshole," Thomas said.  "Let's just toss him out the 
door."<P>

I picked up a bottle, wondering if they were about to come at me and
planning to throw it at their heads.  Now's the right moment, I thought.
Throw it.  I picked it up and ... poured myself a full glass.<P>

The tension broke and they began to ignore me again.  They had begun
to move their chairs closer together, and as the restaurant emptied out
they had room to recline in their chairs and light cigars.  I sat glaring
alone at my solitary side of the table.  They began to share amusing 
stories again, and Zorko continued to tell the most fantastic of the tales.
From time to time, in drunken ecstasy, they would embrace and kiss.  They talked
and talked, even daring to touch upon literary and philosophical subjects 
which they must have known I knew more of than they knew.  I simply smiled
derisively at them through it all.<P>

I was, of course, in an utterly ridiculous position, merely pretending with
the utmost desparation that I had some plan with which to extract myself.  Now
and then I was pierced to the heart with the deepest, most venemous pain at
the thought that ten years would go by, and twenty years, and forty, and even
then after forty years I would recall with shuddering humiliation these dirtiest, 
most ludicrous, most terrible moments of my entire life.<P>

My enemies simply behaved as if I were not there.  Once, when Zorko began
to speak about Shakespeare, I let out a burst of derisive laughter.  They
stared at me for a moment, then resumed their chatter.<P>

I gathered from their conversation that they were planning to end the
evening by indulging in a debauchery that was then fashionable among
young New York City bankers.  Certain "white collar" whorehouses had 
sprung up recently, most of them in <I>chic</I>-ly frightening 
outer-borough industrial slums in Williamsburg, Brooklyn or Long Island
City, Queens.  Stephen and Freddy were speaking with fondness of a Long
Island City establishment they'd recently frequented, and promised
to reserve a certain notable young lady there for their guest of honor.
I listened with horror and intrigue to this.<P>

"Gentlemen!" cried Zorko, rising from his seat.  "Let us go <I>there!</I>."<P>

"Of course, of course!" they all shouted. <P>

I turned sharply toward Zorko, exhausted and broken.  I was ready to give up,
ready to do anything to end my agony.<P>

"Zorko!" I said.  "I beg your forgiveness!  Yours too, Freddy!  All of you! 
I insulted you all!"<P>

"A-ha," Freddy said.  "You were about to get your teeth handed to you."<P>

"I ask for your friendship," I said to Zorko.  "I'm sorry I insulted you."<P>

At that he smiled malevolently.  "Insulted me?" he said. 
"You!  I'll have you know that <I>you</I> can never, under any circumstances,
insult <I>me</I>."<P>

"That's enough from you, get out of the way!"  Thomas said with finality.  
"Let's go!"<P>

"She is mine, that's agreed!" cried Zorko.<P>

"She is yours, we won't dispute it!" they answered, laughing.<P>

I stood there.  Thomas began to strike up a song as they piled noisily
out to the street.  Stephen stayed behind to compute the tip.  I 
approached him.<P>

"Stephen!"  I said.  "Let me have a hundred dollars!"<P>

He stared at me with extreme astonishment, his eyes dull.  He was
also drunk.<P>

"You aren't thinking of following us <I>there</I>?"<P>

"Yes, I am!  I will avenge myself!"<P>

"Forget it!" he said curtly and began to put his wallet away.  I grabbed 
his arm.  "Stephen!  I see that you have money.  Have mercy on me.  You
saw what they did to me.  I must not let it end this way.  Everything
depends on it, my whole future, all my plans ..."<P>

Stephen tore a bill out of his wallet and threw it at me.  "Take it,
you pathetic idiot!" he said, and he rushed out the door.<P>

The waiters, who had heard everything, stared at me with curiousity
as I stumbled out onto the street, watching as their cab pulled away.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>strong, loud music from the climax of Enesco rhapsody.  Surreal
shots of narrator's face in fury, as he chases down a cab and pursues the 
party.  The cab scenes have no words.  He arrives on the street and enters
what looks like a desolate warehouse, finding inside a red-lit parlor with
three or four scantily clad women inside.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

They were nowhere to be found.  I asked one of the women if four men 
had immediately preceded my arrival.  I understood by her answer that
they had already met their partners and had left with them for 
further carousing.<P>

Before me was a pretty girl, somebody I was surprised to find myself
feeling a certain pitying affection for.  There was something simple
and kind in her face.  Perhaps something nasty stirred within me as
well.  I knew that I must seem repulsive to her, especially in my
present ridiculous condition.  I knew that I should have left, but 
I did not.<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>THREE: BROTHEL SCENE</CENTER><HR><HR><P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>fast waking-up music from Enesco.  
the scene is acted out in a dimly lit bedroom.  The music fades 
to a strange, treated clock tick.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

Somewhere behind a partition a clock wheezed as if someone were
pressing on it hard, throttling it.  I awakened, although I had
not been asleep.  <P>

Everything came to my mind at once, without any effort, as 
thought it had been waiting to pounce at me once again.  But
strangely, all that had happened to me seemed now, on awakening,
to belong to some faraway remote past, as if I had left it all
behind.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>we see the eyes for several frames, expressions
questioning yet hostile and indifferent.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

Suddenly I saw beside me two open eyes, examining me with steady
curiousity.<P>

In the debauchery that ended the evening, I had spoken no words, 
I now realized, to this poor creature.  I suddenly realized with
utmost clarity how repulsive and absurd I'd been towards her, 
only hours before.  I felt as loathsome as a spider.<P>

"What is your name?" I asked.<P>

"Liza," she replied, somehow ungraciously, and quickly looked
away.<P>

I was silent a while.  "Terrible weather today," I said.  She 
did not answer.<P> 

"How long have you been here?" I blurted out.<P>

"Where?" she asked.

"This place."

She responded, certainly lying: 'A couple of weeks."<P>

"Where are you from?" I asked.  She said "New Jersey."<P>

God knows why I did not leave.  I felt increasingly depressed and
wretched.  The events of the whole day began to flow in confusion through
my mind, independent of my will.  I continued trying to make 
small-talk with Liza, and I found myself pestering her with 
questions.  Finally she asked,
"Why are you asking me so much?" with a rising irritation.  I
said "I'm not interrogating you.  It's none of my business,
after all, it means nothing to me.  It's just that ... I
feel sorry."<P>

"For who?"<P>

"For you," I said.<P>

She said "No need."<P>

"So," I said.  "You think you're on the right path?"<P>

She said "I don't think anything."<P>

This gave me the chance I was hoping for to begin delving into
her.  I could not resist, especially in the state I was in after
the events of the previous night.  I longed to express some 
"cherished little ideas" I'd nurtured in my private corner.  
Suddenly something was fired in me.  I had a purpose.<P>

I began interrogating.  I imagined that she was the property of
somebody, a madam or a pimp, and I made inquiries about this and
discovered that, as I'd suspected, she was already completely 
enslaved, by means of a supposed debt that she somehow had begun 
owing to her employer.  I informed her that it was all a scheme,
that she would never find her way out of this indebtedness, that she
was now utterly someone else's property, and would remain so until
her worth had diminished, which, I assured her, would be sooner than
she expected, given the hardships of her chosen profession.  I then
turned and began a different tack, asking if she'd ever been in love,
asking if she wouldn't rather live the way others lived.  I was
totally caught up in my words, caught up in the "sport" of it.  I began
asking about her father and mother, supposing she had one of each 
somewhere, and asked what her father would think if he could see her,
and I told her that if I had a daughter, if I should have ever been so
blessed, I would have done anything to prevent her from suffering what
she now was suffering, and I asked if perhaps her own father, wherever
he was, might help her save her life.  Perhaps this was cruel of me, as I
imagined her father might not have actually been as concerned with her as
I painted him to be; perhaps, also, I did not care if I was being cruel.
I wanted to get through to her.  And after I brought my lecture to an
end I thought I had succeeded, because a warm smile had crept its way
onto her hardened lips -- but then she disappointed me when she said,
simply:<P>

"It's like ... you're saying something out of a book!"<P>

This stung me to the quick.  It wasn't what I hoped for.  A vindictive
anger flared up in me.  Just you wait, I think.<P>

I then began my tirade in earnest.  I held nothing back now.  I told her
the truth about the ugly acts she engaged in for profit, that it made
her a vile and despised thing in the eyes of the world, in the eyes
of herself, and even in my own eyes.  I held before her the image
of herself after a year or two of this abuse -- harried and prematurely
aged, kept alive by narcotics, increasingly devalued as fresher victims
came in before her, until finally she was thrown out into the winter cold
and left for dead.  And finally I spoke of love, and I cruelly asked
again whether anyone had ever loved her, whether there was anybody in
the world who truly cared whether she lived or died, who appreciated
her inner beauty ... and at this I suddenly saw that I had succeeded.  
Because she began to cry. <P>

I froze, surprised at my own success for a moment.  Then I went to her.
"Liza, my dear, I shouldn't have ... I'm sorry," I said.  I took out my
wallet and on a crazy impulse took out my business card with my address
at work and begged her to come see me.  She said "I'll come."<P>

I knew it was time for me to go, and I quickly dressed.  As I did so she
lept up suddenly and began searching in her pocketbook for something.  Then,
without explaining a thing, as if I were some higher being who understood
everything without words -- she handed me a slip of paper.  It was a letter
to her from some medical student or other -- a very high-flown and
flowery, but extremely respectful declaration of love.  I don't recall
the expressions now, but I remember very well that through the 
grandiloquence I sensed genuine emotion, which can never be faked.  She looked 
at me with childlike excitement.  Poor thing, she had once been loved by 
someone, somewhere, and she had kept his letter as a precious jewel, and she
had wanted to show me this one precious possession, not wanting me to
leave without learning that she too was loved honestly and sincerely, that
she too was treated with respect.  The poor thing ... I was very anxious to
get away now, and I did so.<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>FOUR: CUBICLE WARS</CENTER><HR><HR><P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>Walking home, in rumpled suit, through
falling snow.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

I walked all the way home.  I was exhausted, crushed, bewildered.
I slept, and in the morning I puzzled over my interaction
with Liza.  Why the hell had I given her my business card?  
What if she actually came to my place of work, what would 
I do then?  I could not worry about it, though, because I first had to
save my reputation with Stephen and Zorko and Freddy and 
Thomas.  Most importantly, I had to pay Stephen back the
money I had hastily borrowed.  <P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>At work, entering Tony's office and borrowing
money.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

That day at work, I resolved on desparate measures -- 
borrowing from Tony, my boss.  Fortunately, he was in an 
excellent mood when I stepped into his office, and 
immediately lent me the money I needed.  I was so overjoyed
by this that I even found myself telling him, very
casually and with a devil-may-care attitude, that I'd
been "out celebrating with friends the other night
at the Paris Hotel; seeing off an old friend ... and
naturally we drank a bit more than we'd planned and ...
so on and so forth ..."  All spoken lightly, without a care.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>At his desk, writing a letter.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

I then began writing a letter to accompany my payment to
Stephen.  To this day I recall
with admiration the truly gentlemanly, good-humored, candid 
tone of my letter.  Smoothly, with dignity, and without
superflous words, I took the blame for everything upon 
myself.  I excused myself, "if I may attempt any excuses," 
by saying that I'd become unfortunately inebriated while
waiting for them that first hour.  I apologized chiefly
to Stephen, and begged him to transmit my explanation to 
all the others, and particularly to Zorko, whom, "I recall
as if in a dream," I seemed to have insulted.  I added that 
I would have called upon each of them myself, but my head
ached and, still worse, I was too embarassed.  I was 
thrilled by the lightness, even carelessness (kept to
proper limits, of course) of style which flowed from my pen 
and, better than any possible arguments, immediately 
conveyed that I regarded "all that unpleasantness last night"
with considerable nonchalance, that I was not at all, not
in the slightest crushed, as these gentlemen must have
thought, but on the contrary, regarded everything as it
should be regarded by and calmly self-respecting gentleman.
"A decent man may slip once in a while."<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>Talking to camera -- admiring his
own brilliance.</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

There was even an aristocratic playfulness, I thought, as 
reread the note.  Others in my place would not have known
how to extricate themselves.  Any maybe it really had
been the alcohol!  Of course, I hadn't actually drank any
while waiting that first hour for them.  I had lied
shamelessly.  But ... to hell with it!  I'd disentangled myself.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>At work, distracted at his desk.
</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

Still, the next few days I could not escape the tormenting
fact that Liza might arrive at my workplace anyday.
What would I do?  I'd posed before her as some kind of hero.  
My dismal cubicle, my piles of papers!  The next several days
I worried about this, and each night as I left work I was 
relieved that the crisis had been averted another day.  As I
began to worry less about her coming, I even took to dreaming,
quite pleasantly, of it happening.  I'd see myself saving her,
precisely through her visits and talks with me.  I would 
develop her mind and educate her.  And finally I'd notice
that she loved me, loved me passionately.  I would pretend not
to see it -- I don't know why!  I suppose simply to make it
more interesting.  At last, embarrassed, beautiful, trembling
and sobbing, she would throw herself at my feet, saying that I
was her savior.  And I'd tell her that I knew this, but that
I hadn't wanted to tell her, because I had been the one to
educate her and bring her up in the world, and for me to tell 
her she loved me would have been simply too despotic ... it
would have been indelicate -- in short, I'd talk myself into
some kind of European, George-Sandian, incredibly noble
refinement.  And finally she and I would marry, and have a 
happy life, and travel abroad, and so on, and so on.  I'd
go on in this vein until I'd thoroughly nauseated myself.<P>

My only distraction during these confusing days were the rude
antics of Paul, an office temp who'd been hired to help me tunnel
my way through the pile of papers on my desk.  Lord, how I
hated him!  We'd been squabbling for months, since the day he
arrived to assist me, at my boss's insistence.  I don't think
I've ever hated anyone in my entire life as I grew to hate him,
especially at certain moments!  He was impudent and lazy and,
for some reason, even though he'd been hired to be my 
assistant, he seemed to look down upon me, to regard me with
intolerable disdain.  He spoke to me sparingly, and whenever
he happened to glance at me, he regarded me with a steady,
majestically arrogant and invariably mocking look.  He
executed his duties with the air of doing me the greatest favor.  <P>

I should have dismissed him, but I did not know how.  He, on his
part, felt that his hourly wage was not enough, and had recently
requested to me that I speak to my boss about seeing to an 
increase in his earnings.  Taken aback by this unexpected 
request, I did not dismiss it utterly with a good hearty laugh
full of ridicule, as I should have, but instead timidly agreed
to transmit the request to my boss.  I did so, but Tony simply 
shook his head and walked off, and now I did not know how to deal
with Paul.  I resolved to get the best of him by saying nothing
about it, to be deliberately silent, in order to subdue his pride 
and force him to be the first to broach the subject.  <P>

But he ended up getting the best of me, because he began standing 
at the entrance to my cubicle and simply staring at me.  If I asked
him what he wanted, he would not answer but go on staring for several
seconds later, and then compress his lips in a special way, turn slowly
with a meaningful air, and retire to his own cubicle.  One day, in a
rage, I did not ask what he wanted but sharply and imperiously
raised my head and stared back at him. But this did not edify me --
he stood his ground and introduced into the competition a sigh, a 
long, deep sigh that seemed to plumb the depths of my moral
degeneration.  He then began to turn away, to exit in triumph.  
And this time, I suddenly flew into a rage.  I'd
already been under too much strain, even without him.  "Wait!"
I shouted, beside myself.  "Wait!  Come back here!  Come back here
I said!"<P>

I'd roared so unnaturally that he reappeared and began to examine me
with some astonishment. <P>

"How dare you stand at my door and stare at me like that!"  I yelled.
He regarded me for half a minute, then began to turn again. "Wait!"
I yelled.  "Don't you move from this spot.  There!  Now answer me!  What
did you expect to see here?"<P>

He paused before answering calmly.  "Is there something you'd like me
to be doing?" he asked insultingly, with the most outrageous composure.  <P>

"Excuse me, that is not what I just asked you, you idiot!"  I screamed.  
"You moron!  Have you been brought here simply to torture me?  To be the
bane of my existence?  I know what you are doing!  You are standing here
because you want to know about your increase, but you've done nothing
to deserve an increase!  Your salary should be lowered!  It's inane 
for you to even ask, it's impudent!  It's simply stupid!"<P>

He stared at me. "You apologize to me right now for your horrible behavior!"
I demanded.<P>

He answered in measured tones.  "I have nothing to apologize for.  You should
apologize to me.  I could register a complaint against you, you know."<P>

"Go!"  I yelled.  "Go to the personnel office right now!  Go register a 
complaint!"<P>

He simply continued to stand there, stupidly, without reason or excuse.<P>

"Forget the personnel office," I said.  "Go immediately right now to
the nearest police station and have me arrested.  Go!  Now!  I want you
to do it."<P>

At this he simply simpered out of my cubicle and into his own, and
began fidgeting with his keyboard.  I followed him in.  "Go right this
minute!"  I screamed to the back of his head.  "Go, or you don't know
what I'm about to do."<P>

He spoke, without even troubling to turn his head.  "You are completely 
out of your mind now," he informed me. <P>

I could not help myself.  I grabbed his shoulder and hissed at him.  "I said
go to the police and have me arrested.  Go right this minute."<P>

I became slightly aware of a presence in the hallway outside the cube.  I 
turned and looked and saw an office-mate staring puzzlingly at me.  "There's
somebody here to see you," he said.<P>

<HR><HR><CENTER>FIVE: DISASTER</CENTER><HR><HR><P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>We see Mike standing with Liza in the hallway.
</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

I stood before her, crushed, humiliated, sickeningly ashamed, and, I think,
smiling as I struggled desperately to regain my composure.  Paul leered
rudely at both of us.  Liza, worst of all, seemed to be herself acutely 
embarrassed at having arrived.<P>

"Sit down," I said mechanically.  She obediently did so, gazing at me 
wide-eyed, as if expecting something of me.  This naive expectation, 
given the extremely awkward situation I was in, threw me into a rage,
but I constrained myself.  <P>

"You've found me in an odd position, Liza," I said.  I struggled for
something else to say.  "Would you like some coffee?"<P>

"No ..." she said. <P>

I sat in the midst of the blind rage in which I'd been caught.  She
looked at me anxiously.  Finally I slammed my fist on my desk.  "I'll
murder him!"<P>

She looked at me inquisitively.  "I'll murder him, I'll murder him!"
I yelled.  And suddenly I broke down into sobs.  It was a nervous 
seizure.  I was mortified, but I could not restrain myself.<P>

She was frightened.  "What is it!  What's the matter?"<P>

I begged her to get me water -- this was an act, an attempt to save
face, because actually I could have done very well without water.  But
it gave me a moment to gather myself, and made it seem as if I were 
suffering some sort of physical fit.<P>

"Liza," I said.  "You must despise me."<P>

She was too embarrassed to say anything.  I suddenly felt a terrible
fury towards her.  What had she come for?  What was she expecting from 
me?  I resolved, in my anger, to punish her with silence, to simply sit
and not say anything at all, to make her say what it was she expected
of me.<P>

We sat in terrible silence for five minutes.  Finally she began to
speak.  "I ... want to ... leave that place." she said.  <P>

What could I say to this.  I nodded, and we fell back into silence.  
Finally I asked, "And what did you come here for?  What did you 
expect I'd be able to do for you?"<P>

She did not answer.  "I'll tell you why you came.  It was because
you believed the pathetic, foolish words I uttered last time we met.
You believed me.  And now you see who I really am.  And I want you
to know that I always knew there was nothing I could do to help
you.  I was laughing at you as I spoke those sentimental words!  And
I'm laughing at you now!  Why are you trembling?  You see, that night
I'd been badly insulted at dinner, by a group of men who then left
to finish the evening at your fine establishment.  And I followed them
there, hoping to thrash the life out of these men.  When I arrived
they were already out of sight, so I took my anger out on you.  I
played a joke on you.  I was humiliated, so I had to humiliate
somebody else.  I'd been treated like a piece of garbage, so I 
had to show my power over somebody lower than myself.  That's why
I misled you.  And you actually believed me!  You thought I could
somehow save you!"<P>

I thought she wouldn't be able to understand my words, but as I 
spoke I saw that she understood the essence.  She understood all
too well.  She turned pale as a sheet, she wanted to say 
something, but she did not.  <P>

"I knew you would come here," I said.  "And the moment I gave
you my card I cursed myself for doing so.  I hated you because
I lied to you.  Because all I could do was play around with words,
dream a bit in my mind, but in reality, do you know what I want?
I want to see you all in hell, that's what I want.  All of you ...
I only want peace.  I would sell the world for a single dollar,
just so nobody would bother me.  Should the world go to hell,
or should I have a cup of coffee?  I say I'll have a cup of 
coffee.  I'm a scoundrel, a piece of scum, an egotist, and
a lazy good-for-nothing.  This is why I've been dreading that
you would come.  I'd posed as a hero before you, and I would
never be able to keep up this pose.  And so you find me growling
at my own assistant, flying helplessly at him, like a rapid puppy
on a chain.  And then you see me cry.   Well for this I'll never 
forgive you.  And I'll never forgive you for what I'm confessing
to you now.  Because I am myself the vilest, the most vain 
and ridiculous, the stupidest  and most envious of all worms
on earth.  And I spend my life getting slapped around.  Why are
you sitting there staring at me?  Don't you realize how much
I'll hate you now, having said all this, because you were here
and heard me?  Don't you know that a man will only say these
things once in a lifetime?  Why don't you leave?  Why do you
torture me?"<P>

And as I went on with my hysterics, a strange thing happened.  
Liza, insulted and humiliated by me, somehow understood 
everything much better than I'd imagined she would.  She 
understood that I myself was unhappy.  And the shock and
hurt on her face gave way to grieved surprise.  When I 
shouted "Why don't you leave?  Why do you torture me?" she
reacted not with fear or confusion, but with the
kind knowledge that somebody before her was in pain and
needed help, needed it even more than she needed it.   And
somehow, after all the abuse I'd hurled in her direction,
she reached out a hand to take mine.  My heart seemed to
turn over.  It was impossible for me not to break down 
again into a sob.<P>

"THey won't let me ... I can't be ... good!" I said.  <P>

Still, the trouble was, my fit of hysteria had to end.  
Eventually I would have to raise my eyes and look into
Liza's face, and how could I do so?  Now our roles
had been completely reversed -- now she was the heroine,
and I was the humbled and broken creature who needed to
be saved.  How had I gotten myself into this?<P>

I wished for her to leave, but she did not leave.  I know
this whole story seems incredible.   It seems impossible
that any person could be as stupid and vicious as I was.  Here
was a chance for me to love, a last chance, a chance I did not
deserve.  But I could not take it.  Because I had in me no 
capacity to love.  The only relationship I could ever have
anymore was one of tyrannization masking itself as love.<P>

So I wanted her to disappear.  I wanted "peace."  Finally 
she sensed this, after long minutes of stillness and silence, 
and began to put her coat back on.  "Goodbye?" she said.<P>

And then I did something unbelievably cruel.  I should not
have done this, and do not know why I did.  I had to insult
her before she left, and so I took a number of bills from 
my wallet and, before she left, pressed them into her hand.  
This cruelty was so make-believe, so invented, so bookish,
that I could not even endure it myself.  The moment
she left, I sprang to my feet to stop her.  I saw that she
had, of course, been noble and wise enough to deflect my
stupid and misdirected insult, as she had simply dropped
the bills I'd placed in her hand neatly on to the nearest
cabinet-top.<P>

"Liza," I called down the hallway.<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>He walks to the elevator lobby.</I>
</CENTER><STRONG><P>

"Liza?"<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>He walks out onto the lobby of the office
building, then, without his coat, outside onto the street.</I>
</CENTER><STRONG><P>

"Liza?  Liza?  Liza!"<P>

</STRONG><CENTER><I>He walks down Wall Street, seeing that she's gone, but
hoping to find her, looking in all directions.  He sees the
subway station at the corner of Wall St. and Broadway, and realizes
she must be already gone.  He looks up and sees Trinity Church.  
Music starts.  Lost, agonized, he walks towards the church, walks
inside, finds a pew and falls to his feet in prayer -- the only thing
he has left to do.  The scene lingers on a freeze frame of this.
</I></CENTER><STRONG><P>

Shouldn't I conclude my Notes at this point?  It seems to me it was
a mistake to start them.  At any rate, I have felt ashamed at every 
moment while telling this story, therefore this is not literature but
corrective punishment.  Because telling a long tale about my moral
degeneration, my vanity and my misery in my little corner of the
underground ... well, a good story requires a hero, and there's no
hero here!<P>

But permit me: I have in my own life simply carried to the extreme that 
which most never carry even halfway.  We all agree that real life is
inferior to the life we find in books.  But why do we all fuss and fidget,
why do we yearn for freedom and independence?  Just try, just give us our
freedom and independence, just untie the hands of any one of us, broaden
our scope of action, and ... why, I assure you, we shall immediately beg
to be placed under tutelage again.<P>

Or just leave us on our own, without a book to read, and we shall 
instantly become confused and lost.  We are stillborn; for a long
time we haven't even been begotten of living fathers, and we like this
more and more.  We have developed a real taste for it.  We'll soon
invent a way of somehow getting born from an idea.  But enough, I 
do not want to write any more "from Underground."<P>
