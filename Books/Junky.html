	<A HREF="page.jsp?what=WilliamSBurroughs">William S. Burroughs</A> never planned on being a writer.  He'd written stories as a child and had a superb literary background, but as a young man his only aspiration was to explore America's seedy urban underworlds.  When he finally became a writer, it was only because of the unwritten rule that everybody who hangs out with <A HREF="page.jsp?what=JackKerouac">Jack Kerouac</A> and <A HREF="page.jsp?what=AllenGinsberg">Allen Ginsberg</A> shall write at least one book.  "Junky," Burroughs' first book, was a straightforward account of his life as a heroin junkie.   Now, forty years later, the book sparkles with literary promise, but in the early fifties it was suitable for publication only as a sensationalistic pulp paperback. Ginsberg's friend <A HREF="page.jsp?what=CarlSolomon">Carl Solomon</A>'s uncle ran Ace
Books, and Ace was so nervous about taking responsibility for this shockingly frank story that they coupled it with another book by a narcotics agent, telling how he chased and caught people like Burroughs. <P>

Not wanting his family to know he had written such a nasty book (they supported him financially), Burroughs assumed his mother's maiden name, Lee. "Junky" by William Lee was forgotten soon after it came out in 1953, and rediscovered after '<A HREF="page.jsp?what=NakedLunch">Naked Lunch</A>' made Burroughs famous.  <P>

One of the most memorable early scenes in the book describes how Burroughs insinuated himself into the underworld by making a drug deal with two sleazy characters, one of them based on <A HREF="page.jsp?what=HerbertHuncke">Herbert Huncke</A>, who would also be a published writer by the time Kerouac and Ginsberg were through with him.<P>

NOTE ON SPELLING: A heroin addict is a junkie, not a junky, as far as I'm concerned.  But I've always known Burroughs' book to be called 'Junky' -- until I found the original Ace Books cover (reproduced above) and realized that the original title was 'Junkie' after all.  So I have no idea why the book is universally known as 'Junky.'  This is, nevertheless, the case.<P>
