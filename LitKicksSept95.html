Turn off your mind relax and float downstream.<P>

This is my personal project, unaffiliated with any corporation, university or
organization, and dedicated to a couple of writers who mean a lot to me.  
There's a lot of material here, much of it written by me, plus some 
contributions by friends, relatives, cool people on the 'Net, and a 
couple of well-known Beat scholars and subterranean types who I met through
this project.  To enter the labyrinth click on one of these names :

There's a brand-new (as of May '95) better-than-ever 
<A HREF="Biblio/SherriBiblio.html">Beat Bibliography</A> here, and 
I'm also trying to keep up to date on
<A HREF="News/BeatNews.html">recent Beat news</A>
 and finish a new section on some 
<A HREF="Topics/LatterDayBeats.html">latter-day Beat writers of the 60's</A>.
Finally, if you want you can read about what happened last February when I

<P>

I'm not any special kind of expert on these topics, and I've never
met any of the Beats in person, although I once stood next to a friend 
while he got Allen Ginsberg's autograph at a poetry reading (Ginsberg, 
by the way, was very gracious).  I'm a fiction writer myself, and 
I'm lately putting the finishing touches on my first Web fiction project, 
<I><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Queensboro">Queensboro Ballads</A></I>,
which I hope you'll visit sometime when you get a chance.
I'm adding stuff to Literary Kicks (and fixing typos) as I go 
along, so check back with me here occasionally.<P>

Literary Kicks went live on July 23, 1994, and I've gotten a great 
response since then.  I've received many nice notes of encouragement, 
some contributions, and zero flames (so much for the myth of the unfriendly 
Internet).  I'm always happy to get feedback, and my e-mail address is at the 
bottom of the page.  <P>

All the text here is copyrighted by me, except for the actual 
excerpts from Beat writings.  Thanks to the people at 
<A HREF="http://www.charm.net/index.html">Charm.Net</A>
for providing a very well-managed and affordable service.  
I created the "postage stamp" images on some of these pages with a $150 
Logitech hand-held scanner and a $50 copy of PC Paintbrush (so please don't be 
too critical of my graphics, I'm strictly an amateur).  The image at the top of
this page is my alteration of a picture of Paul Verlaine, the 19th Century 
French poet.  The quote under it (turn off your mind ...) is from John 
Lennon.<P>
