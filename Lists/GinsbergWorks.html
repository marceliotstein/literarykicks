<H3> <IMG SRC="../Portraits/ag_beech.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=225>The Works of Allen Ginsberg</H3>

<I>If I told you I'd read every word here I'd be lying so bad ... <P>

I've read the 'major' ones, though, and I really like them.  Poetry sometimes 
puts me to sleep, but Ginsberg's poetry is just so crammed
with manic energy that I stay awake and end up getting into it.  None of that
'Sominex' effect here.  Ginsberg is a crazed individual, and he has the 
intelligence and artistic instincts to capture his crazed vision in words. <P>

He is probably the only Beat poet whose work stands tall by any measure.
Many poets (for instance, 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>) 
can do beautiful and subtle things with words, but don't often grab your 
attention.  You have to already be in a 'poetic mood' to hop on to a 
Snyder wavelength; his work isn't likely to transform you if you
haven't already committed yourself to being transformed.  Others, like
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>, 
are the opposite: they get your attention, but don't fully deliver on that 
rarefied, erudite poetic stuff that the college professors and 
little old ladies like so much. <P>

But Ginsberg is *All That* (as Charles Isbell would say in his 
<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/~isbell/HFh/reviews/000-toc.html">Hip/hop Review Web Site</A>).
He is PhunkyDopePhat++ and even sings good.  So check out some of this stuff 
listed down below.  <P>
