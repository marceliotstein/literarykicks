Suicide note found May 23 by Snyder, "I never could make anything work 
out right and now I'm betraying my friends. I can't make anything out of 
it - never could. I had great visions but never could bring them together 
with reality. I used it all up. It's all gone. Don Allen is to be my 
literary executor- use MSS at Gary's and at Grove Press. I have $2,000 in 
Nevada City Bank of America - use it to cover my affairs and debts. I 
don't owe Allen G. anything yet nor my Mother. I went Southwest. 
Goodbye. Lew Welch."
