<H3>Kerouac Periodicals</H3> 

These are the Kerouac-based periodicals I know of, and one general

<I>Dharma Beat</I> is affiliated with the Jack Kerouac subterranean 
Information Society.  They're based in 
<A HREF="../Places/Lowell.html">Lowell</A>
and run a Kerouac celebration there each fall.  Attila Gyenis is the

<H3>The Kerouac Connection</H3>

The Kerouac Connection</I> has been in print for many years, and has 
published in-depth research on topics related to Kerouac and his works.  
There is also a new Kerouac Connection
<A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/kerouacconnection">website</A>.<P>

Editor Mitchell Smith sent the following submission guidelines:<P>

<I>
Reviews of beat related publications and recording are sought.  1-2 single
spaced typed pages.  Email me first for approval of the material to be
reviewed (save yourself some work this way).  A large number of new
publications have yet to be reviewed.<P>

Critical writings on Beat Generation texts sought.  4-8 single spaced typed
pages.  Textual work on Kerouac is preferred but biographical or other
criticism also welcomed as well as writings on other Beat figures.  News
articles also sought on current topics.<P>

Art and photos.  Currently we do best with black and white reproductions.
 Best to mail camera ready art appropriate to 8.5" x 5.5" magazine format.
Interested in photos of Beat figures and places as well as artistic work
focusing on Beat subject matter or Americana (urban and rural) in the style
of Robert Frank.<P>

Poetry.  Submit 1-5 poems, prefer 1 page in length. Does not need to be
neo-Beat in subject or style (in fact I am getting tired of that).  Prefer
contemporary detailed realism that describes images with accuracy and
insight.  Charles Bukowski is a stylistic model here (tho imitation of his
subject matter is not desired, be yourself).<P>

Prose.  Submit 1-5 single space pages.  We cannot use longer prose at this
time.  May be prose sketches or short stories.  We do not seek specifically
Beat or Kerouac-inspired work but prefer a focus on American places,
characters, and scenes.<P>

ALL SUBMISSIONS MUST INCLUDE SASE.<P>

Subscriptions are $20 for 4 issues.  Sample issue can be obtained for $5.
Make checks payable to The Kerouac Connection.<P>
