A Preliminary Checklist of the Writings of d.a. levy (1942-1968)

by JAMES R. LOWELL

DEAR D.A.,

Well, old friend, the sackcloth of respectability has been laid upon you.  A
scholarly and respected library journal is devoting an issue to you and your
writings.  Imagine your ashes will ignite the Cuyahoga over it, but at least
it will be a pure flame.  It certainly isn't a complete checklist but it is a
start.  Your good friends, Douglas Blazek and Kent Taylor have been most
helpful in preparing it.  With a couple exceptions I've limited the list to
those publications entirely by you, and those edited by you.  As your old
gadfly, Colonel  J. Williams, would exclaim, ONWARD!
