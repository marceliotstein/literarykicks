(I got this from rec.music.gdead ... thanks to Ken
Schumacher for letting me include it here.  Ken also sent 
me John Perry Barlow's write-up on 
<A HREF="../Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html">Cassady and 'Cassidy'</A>,
which Barlow gave me permission to include in Literary Kicks.
This was last updated in 1995.)<P>

For those interested in learning more about Neal Cassady, 
there is a wealth of material about this amazing man.  
I began to collect this list with the help of many helpful 
souls who responded to my Cassady Quest postings many months 
ago.  I keep updating it as I read new dead-flames postings.
If anyone has any  corrections or additions to this listing, 
by all means send me e-mail and I will update it and repost.<P>

OK, time to grovel, again.  Someone mentioned Neal Cassady
introduced the Dead on stage at a couple Fillmore shows in 
1967. Does that ring a bell to anyone out there?  Does anybody
have tapes of these shows?  I'd love to hear Neal do his thing 
in the proper context of a dead concert. <P>
