<I>Last Updated: 1995</I><P>

Burroughs is a hard guy to catalog.  He contributed
readily to many zines and small publications, and enjoyed collaborating on
loose terms with a wide variety of creative people.  I think it's safe to
say that this list represents only a fraction of his entire body of work.<P>

Burroughs recently appeared in a sneaker commercial -- I can't 
remember if it's Adidas or Nike or whatever (am I alone here in that I
don't see footwear as a deeply meaningful experience and don't give a 
fuck what kind of sneakers I'm wearing?) <P>
