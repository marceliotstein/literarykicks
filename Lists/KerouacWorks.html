<I>Look into the mirror.  You have just captured the essence of what 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
spent his entire literary career doing. <P>

Almost everything he wrote was autobiographical.  Like 
<A HREF="../People/ThomasWolfe.html">Thomas Wolfe</A>, 
he saw writing as identical with introspection.  The word 'fiction' does
not really describe his work.  It was more like self-directed 
psychoanalysis, except that his outlook was more religous and tragic than 
psychological. <P>

His books are crowded with his friends, lightly disguised behind new names.  
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>, 
for instance, appears variously as Carlo Marx, Adam Moorad, Irwin Garden,
Leon Levinsky and Alvah Goldbrook.  Late in his life, Kerouac even considered 
publishing a unified edition of all his works, with all the characters 
representing himself appearing under a single name, Jack Duluoz (French for 
'Jack the Louse').<P> 

I normally list writings by date of publication, but in Kerouac's case
the date of publication is less relevant, as he wrote most of his novels during
the long hungry period between the publication of his first and second 
novels.  He then published them one at a time through the rest of his life.
For this reason, I'll list the works according to the period of his life that 
they reflect, rather than publication date. <P>

I compiled this from various
sources.
At this point it's far from complete -- for instance it does not include 
numerous magazine articles that have never been published in book form.
I also can't guarantee that there are no mistakes, though I don't think 
there are any.  If you find one, please let me know.<P> </I>
