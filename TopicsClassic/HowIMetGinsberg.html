<P><BR><P>

On May 11 1997 I went to a memorial for Allen Ginsberg at 
Brooklyn College, where he had been a professor till the
time of his death.  I enjoyed sharing a stage with Dennis
Nurkse, the Poet Laureate of Brooklyn, Tuli 
Kupferburg, and many names I'd vaguely
heard of.  I also heard some great poems from various young
poetry students who'd studied under Ginsberg, and it
was wonderful to hear that he indeed did succeed in passing 
the torch on to at least one new generation.<P>

Myself, I was unwilling to attempt to read a 
poem in front of all these well-educated
poetry experts, and I chose instead to read this short memoir 
about the one time I met Allen in person.<P>

<H1>How I Met Ginsberg</H1>

I always used to see Allen Ginsberg around the Village.  I'd go to his
poetry readings, and he'd often show up at other poetry readings I went 
to, especially at St. Mark's Church, or at Buddhist benefits.  But I
avoided meeting him, because there was always such a long line of fans
waiting to get him to sign an autograph.  And sometimes when I looked
at his face, he didn't seem to be enjoying signing the autographs anymore.
Ultimately there were too many fans, more faces than he could remember, and
I think it all became very tiring for him, as much as he loved being
the center of attention.<P>

After I started my Literary Kicks website, I started getting to know
some people who worked with Ginsberg, and I would get invited to
visit his business office.  However, I was afraid to go, first of all because
I felt intimidated by his status as one of History's Great Literary Characters.
I didn't want to actually <I>meet</I> somebody that legendary.  It seemed
like it was somehow interrupting the fame/non-fame continuum, or something.
But that wasn't the real reason I didn't want to go.  The real reason
was that I'd scanned a lot of the photographs in his book "Snapshot
Poetics" and used them in my web pages.  I'd never really asked permission
for this, and I had a feeling I might be in for a serious talking-to
if I casually dropped by the Ginsberg office and announced my name.<P>

So -- it seemed like <I>everybody</I> in Greenwich
Village knew Allen Ginsberg personally, except for me.  Every person in
the village, and I guess every poet in the world.  It got
to be ridiculous -- I'd get e-mail's from Spain and Iceland and
Russia from people who apparently had been exchanging Christmas
Cards with Allen for decades -- and here I was living in the same
city and we'd never met!<P>

Brooklyn College proved to be my answer.  Bill Gargan, the guy
who created the BEAT-L mailing list on Brooklyn College's list
server, also studied Blake in a graduate seminar with Ginsberg.  
He told me they met in Ginsberg's office on campus every Wednesday.
Finally I asked Bill "Do you think I could sit in one day?"<P>

Bill asked Allen's permission and got it, explaining to Allen
that I was the person who ran the Literary Kicks website, which
I knew Allen had never seen since he stayed away from computers --
which I consider a wise decision on his part, by the way -- but 
which I worried Allen might have heard of, since I'd used all these
photos of his without permission.  I figured, though, that if I was ever going
to find Allen in an exalted and non-materialistic mood, it would
be at a Blake Seminar at Brooklyn College.<P>

I arrived, and Allen nodded with a slight shudder of unhappy recognition
when Bill Gargan introduced me to him.  I sat at a seat near
Allen's desk, and he looked up and gruffily mentioned that, as 
a sit-in student, I ought to take one of the crummy seats in the back of
the room.  That seemed to be the extent of my punishment, if there
was to be any punishment at all.  The class consisted of about 20
students, comfortably gathered around his desk in various chairs and
sofas.  Ginsberg passed around 
an eclectic stack of rare, antique-looking hardbound collections
of Blake, and we began to study in 
detail a single passage from a single poem.  During the three
hours of the seminar we read maybe fifty lines, stopping to 
discuss each single one.  Ginsberg managed to steer the conversation
from homosexuality to Marxism to psychedelic mushrooms to CIA 
involvement in South America -- all his favorite topics, all arising
naturally from the words as if Blake had planned it that way from
the beginning.  I raised my hand and attempted to impress him by tying
in Descartes' proof of the existence of God to one of Blake's lines, 
just for the hell of it, but Ginsberg didn't seem especially impressed.
I wanted to make an impression on him, though.  Bill Gargan and I 
hung around after class and talked to Allen for a minute or two.  He
told me he hated computers (I'd already known this) and then he suddenly
reached for his phone book and told me there was somebody I needed to
talk to, a person who worked for Microsoft who was arranging a chat with 
him there.  Allen dialed this poor unsuspecting Seattle 
office-worker's number, announced into the phone "This is Allen Ginsberg, 
there's, uh, somebody who needs to talk to you," and suddenly I found
myself holding the receiver, speaking to a stranger across the continent
who also had no idea what we were supposed to be discussing.  We quickly
found a way to hang up.<P>

On the way out, though, I did manage to get his attention for a minute.  
Somehow, through some feeble excuse, I managed to mutter something about
Raymond Weaver.  Raymond Weaver had been a professor of Ginsberg's at Columbia,
and is also a famous name among Herman Melville scholars for having resurrected the
unknown Melville's reputation in the 1920's, and also for discovering the
manuscript of "Billy Budd."  I suppose I mentioned the name just to impress
Ginsberg -- but maybe it worked, because he suddenly stopped what he was
doing and fixed his eyes upon me for a moment.  He said "You know Melville?"
and I said "Yeah!" (hoping he wasn't about to challenge me with some
hard questions).  He stared at me a moment more and then nodded with
approval.  He started to smile and we talked a few minutes more and
then when we parted he shook my hand firmly.  I think it was Melville
that made the difference.<P>

This was in the autumn of 1996, a few months before Ginsberg died.  I
would run into him again a few times, but this was the one and only
time we actually spoke.<P>

<I>NOTE: About the copyright issue, I should mention
that on a separate occasion I had a few minutes to 
talk to Bob Rosenthal (acting as Ginsberg's
representative on copyright issues) and he was commendably open-minded
and humane in letting me know what he considered fair use of copyrighted
materials and what he did not consider fair use.  In our ego-obsessed age, as 
respectable literary figures fight shamelessly in public over money, 
power and position, it's nice to report that to the end Ginsberg and his 
associates seemed to have avoided catching the "Greed Disease." 
I am honored to have briefly known Allen and the people he worked
with.<P></I>
