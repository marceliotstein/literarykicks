<H1><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="../Images/dylantyping.jpg" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240>Connections</H1>

I discovered the Beats the same way a lot of people did, not 
through books but via the musical connections.  My interest in the Grateful Dead
led me to read "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" as a teenager, and that
was how I first heard of Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac . The first 
time I saw Allen Ginsberg's name was on the liner notes to Bob Dylan's 
great mid-seventies album "Desire." I first knew of William S. Burroughs 
as the author of several strange articles in Crawdaddy, 
my favorite rock music/alternative-culture magazine as a kid (it went out of 
business in the age of disco) and later as some old guy Patti Smith 
talked about a lot in interviews.<P>

All of this got me curious, and I followed the threads.  When I started 
reading the original Beat classics I knew I had found something important
and real, and since I was already very interested in fiction I soon became
personally involved with the whole Beat 'thing.'  The purpose of
this page is to document the musical connections that originally
caught my interest.  There's much more to be said about all this; maybe 
eventually I'll be the one to say it.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="../CommercialArt/acidtest.gif" WIDTH=141 HEIGHT=381>
<H3><A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/dead.html">Grateful Dead</A></H3>

The Dead were Beat-related even before they were the Dead.  When
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey</A>
(Oregon-born LSD pioneer and author of 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest')
began holding public gatherings known as "Acid Tests" in
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A> was his
ever-present co-conspirator and the Warlocks were the house band.
The Warlocks would change their name to the Grateful Dead after 
they discovered the name 'Warlocks' was taken by another band.  I think they
ended up with the better name anyway. <P> 

A poster for one of the later Acid Tests, after the Dead changed their
name, is at left.  This all took place around 1965/66,
before the Summer of Love, before the Hippie 
explosion (in fact this greatly inspired the Hippie explosion, at least in 
Haight-Ashbury).  Dead songs about Neal include 'The Other One' and 
'<A HREF="../Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html">Cassidy</A>'.  I used to think
'He's Gone' was about Neal too, and a lot of people have thought so as
well; it turns out it's not but it could have been.<P>

<H3><A HREF="http://www.punkhart.com/dylan/">Bob Dylan</A></H3>

<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A> 
was Dylan's favorite poet.  Ginsberg became part of Dylan's circle of
friends and worked with him on various projects including the film 
'<A HREF="../Films/DontLookBack.html">Don't Look Back</A>,' 
several early 70's songs, the legendary Rolling Thunder Revue tour, 
and the film associated with the Rolling Thunder Revue,
'<A HREF="../Films/RenaldoAndClara.html">Renaldo And Clara</A>.'
A scene of Ginsberg reading his emotional and shocking poem
'<A HREF="../Poems/Kaddish.html">Kaddish</A>'
to a roomful of unsuspecting elderly mah-jongg players is included 
in 'Renaldo And Clara,' as well as a visit to Jack Kerouac's grave. <P> 

Despite Dylan's close connection to Ginsberg, Dylan's creative point of 
view seems to me even more akin to Kerouac's than to Ginsberg's.  In fact
I suspect (with no evidence at all on this) that the reason Dylan doesn't  
stress how much he has gotten from Kerouac is that he doesn't want to admit
it.  An example of a very Kerouac-like Dylan work: the excellent spoken-word 
performance of 'Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie' on The Bootleg Series.<P>

Kerouac didn't think much of Dylan, according to reports I've heard.  That's
what one would figure, too, given Kerouac's general hostility to the 
hippie/liberal scene of the Sixties.  Anyway, that's Dylan typing
in the picture at the top of this page.  There's a new official
<A HREF="http://bobdylan.com">Bob Dylan website</A> 
now too, and it's really good (I helped build it).<P>

<H3><A HREF="http://k2.princeton.edu/floyd">Pink Floyd</A></H3>

This connection is not as well-known as the Grateful Dead connection, but
Pink Floyd arose from the mid-sixties London psychedelic scene in much the
same way that the Dead arose from Haight-Ashbury.  And just as the 
Haight-Ashbury scene was partly inspired by Ken Kesey with help from Neal 
Cassady, the London psychedelic scene was kicked off by the 1965 International 
Poetry Festival at the Royal Albert Hall, featuring Ginsberg,
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Ferlinghetti</A>,
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Corso</A> 
and others.  This gathering was such a success it led to the initiation of 
Beat/pyschedelic events at clubs like the Marquee, and it was from this 
environment that Pink Floyd, then led by Syd Barrett, emerged. The Soft
Machine were there too, the second-most popular band after the Floyd, 
kind of like what Jefferson Airplane was to the Dead. <P>

Like I said, this connection is not very well-known, maybe because Pink 
Floyd's later popularity with suburban teenage audiences has caused 
'serious' types to look down upon them.  But I was a suburban teenage Pink 
Floyd freak once, and I know how good they were (I say 'were' rather than 
'are' because I'm not too crazy about the recent post-Roger-Waters material).
From the days of the playful and misunderstood genius Syd Barrett to the
stoned hypnotic experiments of 'Ummugumma' and 'Soundtrack From 'More''
to the clock-like perfection of 'Dark Side' and the naked anguish of
'The Wall' and 'The Final Cut,' this band went places no other 
quartet or quintet of electronic-instrument-wielders could possibly
have gone.<P>

The most prominent symbol of the connection between Pink Floyd and the Beats 
is Miles, owner of the Indica bookshop and a key member of the London 
art/poetry/rock scene.  He went on to write the first major book on Pink 
Floyd ('Pink Floyd: A Visual Documentary by Miles') and also wrote the 
first major biography of Allen Ginsberg (as the more conventionally-named 
Barry Miles).  He later wrote a biography of 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> 
as well.  I don't know much about Miles, and I'd sure like to find out 
more.  I understand it was in his bookstore that John and Yoko met. <P>

<H3><A HREF="http://charlotte.acns.nwu.edu/charm/html/lou/">Velvet Underground</A></H3>

You know the International Poetry Festival in London that I mentioned above?
Well, Andy Warhol and Gerald Malagna were there too.  Just as Kesey and Babbs
and Cassady and the Dead were building the Haight-Ashbury scene in San 
Francisco and Miles and Pink Floyd and the Soft Machine were creating 
psychedelic Swinging London, Warhol and his crowd were turning 
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">Greenwich Village</A>
and the Lower East Side into their personal playground for art, film, drugs 
and insanity.  And music: Warhol's house band was the Velvet Underground,
starring Lou Reed and John Cale.  <P>

The connections to the Beats were numerous, but tended to be incidental.  
Ginsberg's crowd and Warhol's crowd shared the same stomping 
ground, the Village and the Lower East Side, but their basic philosophies 
were quite different; Warhol liked to dwell in the negative, nasty, seamy 
side of life, and Ginsberg was a bearded finger-cymbal-clanging flower child.
This kept the two groups from forming any major creative alliances.  But you
can't delve very far into the mid-Sixties activities of either group without
running into the other.<P>

As a lyricist Lou Reed has often been compared to Burroughs, as both are 
fascinated with heroin, down-and-out characters and the seamy side of
the city.  Ted Morgan actually insults Lou Reed in his otherwise
intelligent biography of Burroughs, calling him a cheap Burroughs 
imitation ... as I said, this is a good book aside from this uninformed
remark.  In fact I find Burroughs' and Reed's approaches entirely
different: Burroughs plays with ideas, breaks rules and strives
to make his work incomprehensible as straight narrative, whereas Reed
is a minimalist, writing about emotions and events with simple,
naked clarity.  In his extreme emotional self-revelations, Reed is
actually more similar to Kerouac and Ginsberg than to the enigmatic
Burroughs.  (I also think he's a brilliant guitarist and
songwriter, perhaps my favorite musician of all time.)<P>

Lou Reed was one of the speakers scheduled to present at the Summer 1995 
Kerouac Conference at New York University.  I was surprised when I heard
this, because Lou always maintains a severe ironical distance in his
public persona, and NEVER does things like this.  My reaction was obviously
correct, because Lou's name was dropped from the list soon after, and Graham
Parker's name was added (see below).<P>

<H3><A HREF="http://www.richardhell.com/HellBio.html">Richard Hell</A></H3>

Like Lou Reed, Richard Hell was scheduled to appear 
at a Kerouac tribute in New York, and then did not show up.  In 
Hell's case, it was a reading of Kerouac's letters at St. Mark's Church
in the Bowery, with Ginsberg, Ann Charters, etc.   Graham Parker read
in Hell's place (see below).<P>

Richard Hell and the Voidoids were one of the great original New York
scene punk bands, and Hell coined the term "Blank Generation" (which
never took off anyway, unlike "Generation X," which was the name of 
Billy Idol's band around the same time).  In fact, I recently heard
the Rhino "Beat Generation" boxed set and discovered that "Blank Generation"
was virtually a parody of the super-corny Rod McKuen song "I belong to the
Beat Generation," which was so hokey even McKuen recorded it under a pen
name.  You can hear the original Rod McKuen song on the Rhino/WordBeat
3-CD set "The Beat Generation."<P>

Richard Hell also discovered the great guitarist Robert Quine, who was responsible 
for the Voidoids' distinctive sound.  I used to see the band a lot back when 
I was in high school, and they were great.  <P> 

In case you're interested, here's
<A HREF="http://moon.st.rim.or.jp:1969/">The Blank Generation Web</A>, 
from somewhere in Japan.<P>

<H3>
<A HREF="http://www.punkhart.com/gparker/">Graham Parker</A></H3>

This late-70's new-wave musician is obviously the one Ginsberg calls
up when less responsible musicians like Lou Reed and Richard Hell cancel
at the last minute (see above). <P>

<H3>Weezer</H3>

From the song "Holiday", lyrics sent to me by Rosalind Young
(gyoung@interlog.com).<P>

Somebody had to come up with the "bivouac" rhyme sooner or

<H3>Sonic Youth</H3>

I've always wanted to know more about this band -- you know how there are
sometimes bands that you know must be good and you hear about them all over 
the place, but then somehow you just never get a chance to really listen 
to them?  That's what happened to me with Sonic Youth.<P>

I'm planning to get one of their CD's soon but I'm just so damn busy and
I keep forgetting.  Till then, I get my Sonic Youth Beat Connection info
from Mike McCullough (here's a bunch of Sonic Youth stuff on his 
<A HREF="http://www.evol.org/music.html">music page</A>).
Most recently he told me that Lee Ranaldo has a solo album out called
"Scripture of the Golden Eternity," which is also the name of a 
great piece of Kerouac freeform Buddhist writing that you can read
<A HREF="../Texts/GoldenEternity.html">here</A>.  According to Mike
the album is "the usual lee ranaldo feedback distortion delay loops,
with some spoken spiel interjected over the noise, too weird to have
a lot of mass market appeal, but it is out there. it is on father yod
records distributed by drunken fish." <P>

<H3>Machines of Loving Grace</H3>

The excellent name of this band comes from a Richard Brautigan
poem that speaks (ironically or not?  Both, I guess) of the
beauty and warmth of technology and automation.  I don't have a 
page on Brautigan yet but I will have one someday ... <P>

<H3>The Boo-Radleys</H3>

The name itself is literary, of course, since Boo Radley
was the misunderstood town-outcast/mysterious weirdo in
"To Kill A Mockingbird."  That was not a Beat book though;
they are listed here because of their song 
"<A HREF="../Buk/bukmain.html">Charles Bukowski</A>
is Dead" (which is true, he is).  Thanks to 
Marisha Chinsky (MariannSC@aol.com) for mentioning
this to me.<P>

<H3>Henry Rollins</H3>

This guy's got the Beat spirit for sure.  He even publishes
books by himself and others, such as Exene Cervanka and Nick
Cave.  I think that's admirable.  Check out his publishing company,
<A HREF="http://www.two1361.com/">2.13.61</A>,
named after his birthday.<P>

<H3>Blake Babies</H3>

According to Jay at adrian@microserve.net the people who
would form this band (Juliana Hatfield's old group) were in 
Boston talking to Allen Ginsberg (or something like that) and 
when they asked him what they should call their band 
he suggested the Blake Babies, after 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamBlake.html">William Blake</A>.
And that's how they got their name.<P>

<H3>Smashing Pumpkins</H3>

A song called "Tristessa" may or may not be a reference to Jack
Kerouac's novel of the same name, about a heroin-addicted prostitute
in Mexico. <P>

<H3>Rage Against The Machine</H3>

Allen Ginsberg's poems and words show up often in Rage's
songs.  For instance, the song "Bulls On Parade" includes Ginsberg's
"Hadda Been Playing on the Jukebox." <P>

<H3>Jawbreaker</H3>

Josh Dean (Rebel1955@aol.com) sent me the lyrics to this song, "Boxcar,"
and others have also written to tell me that this band is into Kerouac.
Conchita (conchita@efaxinc.com) mentions also the song "Condition
Oakland" in which Kerouac's voice can be heard.<P>

<H3>Donovan</H3>

Somewhat hippy-dippy folksinger from the 60's who for
a while was going to be the British Bob Dylan, and then veered
towards pop psychedelia and produced cool songs like "Mellow
Yellow."  According to Will Stanley (W.A.Stanley@newcastle.ac.uk),
he sang the line "Ginsberg's taken a trip out east" (certainly 
a true sentiment) in his song "Sunny South Kensington" on his
album "The Trip."<P>

<H3>They Might Be Giants</H3>

Thanks to Daniel Pereira (DGently253@aol.com) for transcribing the 
lyrics to the song "I Should Be Allowed To Think" from the album 
"John Henry."  TMBG is an extremely unique Brooklyn-based duo that 
stretches boundaries between nerd-rock and avant-garde.  This song is 
obviously inspired by Ginsberg's poem
"<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>."  I think these lyrics are
great, especially the line "I saw the worst bands of my generation."<P>

<A HREF="../Topics/LatterDayBeats.html">"latter-day" Beat writers</A>,

in Literary Kicks.  A Fugs discography is included there too.<P>

<H3><A HREF="http://turtle.ncsa.uiuc.edu/alan/beatles.html">Beatles</A></H3>

Lennon hung out with Ginsberg and Dylan a lot in the mid-Sixties,
and now in the 90's McCartney has begun working with Ginsberg for
the first time.  Also,
Burroughs is one of the faces on the cover of 'Sgt. Pepper.'  The name
'Beatles' itself might include a generational reference along with
it's many meanings (it also connotes "beat" as in rhythm, and is an 
homage to Buddy Holly and the Crickets, but it's likely the fab four
were aware of the literary connotation as well).
Finally, as I said above in the Pink Floyd 
section, I believe John and Yoko met in the Indica bookshop, run by Miles. <P>

<H3>The Doors</H3>

Some common influences here: 
Jim Morrison was very interested in the 'deranged' poetry of
<A HREF="../People/ArthurRimbaud.html">Rimbaud</A>.  
And the name of the band came from the Aldous Huxley's
book "The Doors of Perception," which has some proto-Beat 
pedigree.  More directly, Ray Manzarek did a poetry project with 
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A> 
a couple of years ago.  A video of one of these performances, called
"Love Lion," is available from
<A HREF="http://www.mysticfire.com/">Mystic Fire Video</A><P>

<H3>King Crimson</H3>

Created a Kerouac-themed album, 'Beat,' with songs about Kerouac and
Neal Cassady.  I've never heard or seen the album, but David Florkow 
(david.florkow@edu.gov.on.ca) told me that he doesn't particularly like 
it, and that his cats (who have good taste in music and prefer Pere Ubu
and Captain Beefheart) don't either.  Despite this, he sent me the
lyrics to the first song on the first side, 'Neal and Jack and Me':

   Hey Jack Kerouac, I think of your mother and the tears she cried,

were the favorite.  Now they sit and rattle their bones and think
of their blood stoned days.  You chose your words from mouths 
of babes got lost in the wood.  The hip flask swinging madmen, 
steaming cafe flirts, nights in Chinatown howling at night.<P>

   Allen baby, why so jaded?  Have the boys all grown up and 
their beauty faded?  Billy, what a saint they made you, just
like Mary down in Mexico on All Souls' Day.<P>

You chose your words from mouths of babes got lost in the 
wood.  Cool junk booting madmen, street minded girls in Harlem
howling at night.  What a tear stained shock of the world, 
you've gone away without saying goodbye.

Kurt Cobain released a CD of himself playing noise guitar over 
a Burroughs recitation of his short story, 
'The Priest They Called Him.'  Also, according to the 
biography "Come As You Are" (a good book, though the ending
is obviously really sad), Cobain was into Kerouac and once
wrote a song called "Beans" inspired by his novel 
'<A HREF="../Books/DharmaBums.html">The Dharma Bums</A>.'
The song's never been released, but I hope it someday will
be.<P>

<H3>Chuck Berry</H3>

No explicit Beat connections, but there's a definite Kerouac/Cassady sort
of sensibility to his lyrics.  Listen to his 1964 song 'Promised Land,' for 
instance -- something tells me Chuck had a copy of 'On The Road' in his back 
pocket while he was writing this one.  Luckily the Dead play the song, so

<H3>Tom Waits</H3>

Several people have written to say that Tom Waits had a sort of
Beat point of view throughout his work.  David Florkow

<I><BLOCKQUOTE>
jack was sittin poker faced with bullets backed with bitches<BR>
neal hunched at the wheel puttin everyone in stitches<BR>
braggin bout this nurse he screwed while drivin through nebraska<BR>
and when she came she honked the horn and neal just barely missed a<BR>
truck and then he asked her if she'd like to come like that to californy<BR>
see a red head in a uniform will always get you horny<BR>
with her hairnet and those white shoes and a name tag and a hat<BR>
she drove like andy granatelli and knew how to fix a flat<BR>
and jack was almost at the bottom of his md 2020 neal was yellin<BR>
out the window tryin to buy some bennies from a lincoln<BR>
full of mexicans whose left rear tire blowed and the sonsobitches<BR>
prit near almost ran us off the road<P>

well the nurse had spilled the manaschevitz all up and down her dress<BR>
then she lit the map on fire neal just had to guess<BR>
should we try and find a bootleg route or a fillin station open<BR>
the nurse was dumpin out her purse lookin for an envelope and<BR>
jack was out of cigarettes we crossed the yellow line<BR>
the gas pumps looked like tombstones from here<BR>
felt lonelier than a parking lot when the last car pulls away<BR>
and the moonlight dressed the double breasted foothills<BR>
in the mirror weaving outa negligee and a black brassiere<BR>
the mercury was runnin hot and almost out of gas<BR>
just then florence nightingale dropped her drawers and stuck<BR>
her fat ass half way out the window with a wilson pickett tune<BR>

countin one-eyed jacks and whistling dixie in the car<BR>

<H3>Van Morrison</H3>

<A HREF="http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~bridge">Michael Bridge</A>
(bridge@cs.ualberta.ca) sent me this info about Van Morrison and
the Beats: <P>

<I>
There are a number of literary references in Van Morrison's music- there
are many to William Blake, as well as Alan Watts, Rimbaud, Joyce, etc.- 
but there are a couple of brief mentions of Kerouac as well.  (Although
I must say, usually he just invokes their names rather than actually 
alluding to their work.)<P>

One is in "Cleaning Windows" from the album BEAUTIFUL VISION (1982) 
where he talks about a working man's pride in his job and his enjoyment 
of simple daily activities:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	I heard Leadbelly and Blind Lemon<BR>
	On the street where I was born<BR>
	Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee,<BR>
	Muddy Waters sing "I'm A Rolling Stone"<BR>

	Curiosity killed the cat<BR>
	Kerouac's "Dharma Bums" and "On the Road".
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Also, "On Hyndford Street" from HYMNS TO THE SILENCE (1993) is one of
his zillion songs reminiscing about growing up listening to the crackling
mystery of Radio Luxembourg.  One verse is:
	
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Going up the Casltlereagh hills<BR>
	And the cregagh glens in summer and coming back<BR>
	To Hyndford Street<BR>
	Feeling wondrous and lit up inside<BR>
	With a sense of everlasting life<BR>
	And reading Mr. Jellyroll and Big Bill Broonzy<BR>
	And `Really the Blues' by Mez Mezro<BR>
	And `Dharma Bums' by Jack Kerouac<BR>
	Over and Over again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I guess Jack Kerouac and Van Morrison have always coexisted in the same
place in my brain.  Both of them were brought up Christians (I think 
Morrison was a Jehovah's Witness) who later embraced Buddhism, and each 
follows a similar path- the pursuit of the infinite/god/buddha/whatever 
in the face of human reality....  At times, they both can reach it AND 
can communicate it in such a way that make you know exactly what it is, 
even if only for a moment, but at other times you can feel them 
pulling and straining to make sense of even the simplest things....
</I><P>

<H3>Frank Zappa</H3>

I'm sure there are many beat references in the hundreds of extant Frank
Zappa/Mothers of Invention albums.  I can only think of one: the voice
Zappa uses in the spoken-word introduction to 'Muffin Man' (from the
great Beefheart/Zappa live album 'Bongo Fury') is an affectionate (I
think) parody of Ginsberg's odd poetic-reading voice.  This comes out
most explicitly in the pronunciation of phrases like 'dried muffin
remnants' and 'he puts forth a quarter-inch green rosette on the summit
of a dense but radiant muffin of his own design' -- Zappa cracks up
laughing during this last one.  <P> 

<H3>Janis Joplin</H3>

Janis's version of 'Oh Lord Won't You Buy Me A Mercedes Benz' is
pretty well-known, but did you know the song was written by 
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A>?
McClure used to hang around Haight-Ashbury playing songs like this 
one on an autoharp given to him by Bob Dylan, often with the help 
of Hell's Angels like Freewheelin' Frank.<P>

<H3>Jethro Tull</H3>

Jethro Tull, a 70's band that explored the interplay
between British/Celtic folk traditions and high-powered progressive
rock, does not on the surface appear related to the Beats or any other 
American literary tradition.  However, the album 
"Too Old To Rock and Roll," a cycle of songs that appears to be about 
lead singer Ian Anderson's own life, contains the following track, 
a drowsy pub conversation set to music and called "From A Dead Beat To An Old 
Greaser."  This is another reminder of how deeply the Beat movement
had once permeated British culture, despite (or perhaps because of) its 
overwhelming 'American-ness'.   On the other hand, as Ian (the Old Greaser) 
sings: "I wasn't there, friend, I didn't care, friend."  In 
any case, it's a nice song on a mostly-forgotten album. <P>

<I><BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>David Bowie</H3>

David Bowie, with his mask-like face and dry deadpan speaking voice, has often
reminded people of William S. Burroughs.  This is not a coincidence; Bowie is
quite familiar with the works of Burroughs and has even acknowledged the 
stylistic influence in interviews.  For Bowie, whose lyrics often explore the 
concept of fame and pop culture as an insidious control system, Burroughs is a 
natural comrade, along with other 60's media-culture prophets like Andy Warhol 
and Marshall McLuhan.<P>

The most Burroughs-related Bowie work is "Diamond Dogs."  This
fascinating concept album mixes snatches of George Orwell's novel "1984"
with ominous, creepy Interzone-inspired imagery and sounds.  
The album begins with a spoken-word bit called "Future Legend" that could
have come right from a Burroughs cut-up.  On the "David 
Live" album (from a concert tour built around the "Diamond Dogs" concept)
the first thing you hear is the faraway sound of Arab music, as if to set
the show in 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>.  <P>

"Diamond Dogs" (which features the songs "Rebel Rebel" and "1984")
is a great album, probably my favorite Bowie work.  The best bit is 
probably the long, swirling montage called "Sweet Thing," featuring
Mike Garson's amazing "Cabaret"-style piano and some of the
nastiest guitar noises I've ever heard.<P>

And here's a Bowie beat connection I bet you didn't know -- Bowie
recently revealed that he thought up the name of the song "Jean
Genie" while in the 
<A HREF="../Places/CityLights.html">City Lights</A>
bookstore when he spotted a book by the French transgressive
novelist Jean Genet.<P>

<H3>Iggy Pop</H3>

In the song "Little Miss Emperor," cowritten by Pop and Bowie,
he paraphrases from 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>': <P>

<H3>Material</H3>

A few people have told me about the album 'Hallucination Engine,'
which has a song called 'Words of Advice' written and performed 
by Burroughs.<P>

<H3>Ministry</H3>

According to Hayden Burton (godsmess@msn.com), this band is very into
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">Burroughs'</A>
heroin-lore.  There are samples of Bill's voice on the album 
"Psalm 69," and his image appeared in the video for the song
"Just One Fix." <P>

<H3>Skinny Puppy</H3>

Hayden Burton (see above) also tells me of this band's admiration
for Burroughs' heroin-lore, and says the lyrics are often inspired
by Bill's cut-up experiments.<P>

<H3><A HREF="http://www-lsi.upc.es/~jpetit/pg/">Philip Glass</A></H3>

Philip Glass is not exactly a rock musician -- he's more of an
experimental classical type.  He has worked with musicians like Bowie and
Brian Eno, though, so I guess he qualifies.  He's beat-related because
he occasionally collaborates on projects with Allen Ginsberg, and has
performed live with him as well.<P>

<H3>Paul Winter</H3>

Also not a real rock musician but rather a new-age type.  He's done
some work with 
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A>, mostly providing
musical backup while Snyder recites.  I've heard some of these recordings
and they're actually pretty interesting, not
merely relaxing like all that Wyndham Hill new-age stuff.<P>

<H3>Al Stewart</H3>

Thanks to Lindsay Loyd (lindsay.loyd@infoboard.be) for sending me
these lyrics.  I don't know much about Al Stewart, except that he sang
70's-era pop torch songs with quirky lyrics.  The Kerouac reference is
hardly enough to make this a true "Beat Connection", but what the hell.
Here's "Modern Times," written by Dave Mudge and Al Stewart and 
recorded in 1975:<P>

<I><BLOCKQUOTE>
Hello old friend, what a strange coincidence to find you<BR>
It's been fifteen years since we last met, but I still recognised you<BR>
So call the barman over here, and let us fill our glasses<BR>
And drink a toast to olden times where all our memories lie,<BR>
Where all our memories lie.<P>

Do you remember the time when we were young?<BR>
Lowly, lowly, low<BR>
Outside the window the frosty moonlight hung<BR>
On the midnight snow<BR>
So we pulled our scarves around our faces in the night<BR>
Huddled on the doorsteps where the fairylights shone bright<BR>
Singing Christmas carols while our breath hung in the light<BR>
It all comes back like yesterday<BR>
It almost seems like yesterday<P>

Do you remember the changes as we grew?<BR>
Slowly, slowly, slow<BR>
Sneaking in the back way into movies after school<BR>
For the evening show<BR>
Chasing skinny blue jean girls across the building-site<BR>
Checking out the dance floor while the band played 'Hold Me Tight'<BR>
See the blonde one over there--I bet she'd be alright<BR>
It all comes back like yesterday<BR>
It almost seems like yesterday<P>

While I talked he sat and he never made a sound<BR>
Staring at the glass beside me<BR>
Hey old friend, tell me what's on your mind?<BR>
Silence grows on you like ivy<P>

Do you remember the church across the sands?<BR>
Holy, holy, ho<BR>
You stood outside and planned to travel to the lands<BR>
Where the pilgrims go<BR>
So you packed your world up inside a canvas sack<BR>
Set off down the highway with your rings and Kerouac<BR>
Someone said they saw you in Nepal a long time back--<BR>
Tell me why you look away<BR>
Don't you have a word to say?<P>

He said "I don't remember...Don't want to remember<BR>
In fact I've heard too much already<BR>
I don't want to think, just leave me here to drink<BR>
Wrapped up in the warmth of New York City<BR>
Oh, oh, it seems you just don't know<BR>
And you just don't understand me<BR>
I've got no use for the tricks of modern times<BR>
They tangle all my thoughts like ivy."<P>

So I left him, and I went out to the street<BR>
Lowly, lowly, low<BR>
Where the red light girls were coming after me--<BR>
Forty dollar show<BR>
All across the city's heart the lights were coming on<BR>
The hotel lift softly hummed a Cole Porter song<BR>
If I went to look for him I knew he would be gone<BR>
A picture-card of yesterday<BR>
A photograph of yesterday<P>

And far off in a deserted part of town<BR> 
The shadows like a silent army<BR>
Flooded out the rooms in pools of blues and brown<BR>
And stuck to all the walls like ivy<P>

<H3>Dexy's Midnight Runners</H3>

This is sort of like the Jethro Tull mention above -- the 
singer doesn't seem to like Kerouac and Burroughs much himself,
and views the character he's speaking to as somewhat pretentious
for constantly tossing their names about.  This provides an interesting
insight into how the Beats may have been perceived by some in
England and Ireland. <P>

Even if he didn't like Kerouac, though, I liked Dexy's classic
80's song "Come On Eileen" a real lot.<P>

Thanks to Paul Williams (paulw@post.interalpha.co.uk) for sending me these
lyrics.  The song is called "There, There My Dear":<P>

<I>
Dear Robin<P>
I hope you don't mind me writing it's just that there's more than one thing
I need to ask you.  If you're so anti-fashion why not wear flares
instead of dressing down all the same?  It's just that looking like that I
can express my dissatisfaction.   Dear Robin, let me explain though you'll
never see in a million years.  Keep quoting Cabaret, Berlin, Burroughs, JG 
Ballard, Duchamp, Beauvoir, Kerouac, Kierkegaard, Michael Rennie.
I don't believe you really like Frank Sinatra.<P>

Dear Robin, you're always so happy, how the hell do you get your
inspiration?   You're like a dumb patriot.   If you're supposed to be so
angry, why don't you fight and let me benefit from your right?   Don't you
know the only way to change things is to shoot men who arrange things?
Dear Robin, I would explain, but you'd never see in a million years.   <P>

Well you've made your rules but we don't know that game, perhaps I'd listen
to your records, but your logic's far too lame and I'd only waste three
valuable minutes of my life with your insincerity.<P>

them anywhere.  Where have you hidden them?   Maybe you should welcome the

Keep me away from her.<P>

With your kittens, on the patchwork quilt,<BR>

The velvet curtains<BR>
The Chinese bell<BR>
With friends like these, your damned as well.<BR>
Keep me away from her.<P>

Shake off your despondency, and your country girl act.<BR>
You are reading me poetry that's Irish and so black.<BR>
I know you're warm, the warmest person alive,<BR>
But are you warm deep down inside<BR>
I want us to be lovers<BR>
I want us to be friends<BR>
Want it like the world crumbles and then it ends.<BR>

<H3>The Incredible String Band</H3>

This is a classic late-psychedelic-age band that did not survive
the 70's, and I had no idea what had become of the members until I
got this message from John Earley (j.earley@tasc.novell.leeds.ac.uk):<P>

<I>
I've been reading some of your web pages, and was interested to see
your connections between music and the beat authors. I was "turned
on" to Kerouac via my passion for the Incredible String Band, or more
specifically Mike Heron. Unlike the other original String Band man
Robin Williamson (who has played, recorded and toured constantly
since the ISB split in '74) Mike Heron stopped performing and turned
songwriter throughout the '80s, but has been performing again with
the Incredible Acoustic Band for the last three years or so. I could
ramble on for hours about the ISB and the rise of the current wave of
interest in the UK through Andy Roberts' BE GLAD fanzine, but perhaps
I should get to the point!<P>

Heron wrote and recorded a song called Mexican Girl which appeared on
The Glen Row Tapes in 1989; it seems he's a big Kerouac fan - the
song is specifically about Kerouac's Mexican girl in On The Road (her
name has slipped my mind! - typical!) The song led me to the book,
which then led me on to several other Kerouac gems, of which my
favourite is Dharma Bums. (Reading Kerouac also led me
indirectly to John Steinbeck, Hemingway and American literature in
general, having previously been a scifi / fantasy buff all my life)<P>

More recently, Heron has written (and currently performs) a song
called Jack Of Hearts, which is based around the memoirs of Jack's first
wife, whom I've just read about on one of your pages, Edie someone
(I'm terrible with names!) Heron explained the song at a gig recently,
although I didn't catch all the details. I think it's sung in the
person of Edie's later boyfriend / husband lamenting the fact that he
cannot measure up to her original love - Jack Of Hearts.<P>

Clearly Heron is a Kerouac buff. I suppose it ties in with the ISB's
interest in buddhism which I understand can be interpreted from some
of their early material circa 1968, before LRH and Scientology took a
hold. <P>
</I>

(Incidentally, the Mexican girl's name was Terry, and Kerouac's first
wife was Edie Parker.)<P>

<H3>Marillion</H3>

I've never even <I>heard</I> of this band.  Henrik Goransson 
(itp23@und.ida.liu.se) sent me the lyrics to their "Torch Song," and 
I think they're pretty interesting.  The bit about the roman candles
obviously refers to the famous description of Dean Moriarty in the first
few pages of
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>.' 
Henrik also mentions that Kerouac is one of seven "angels" portrayed
on the cover of the album the song is on, and that the cover can be viewed

I remember this band from my college days in the 80's.  But
I didn't realize until GwenKern@aol.com told me that they
got their name from a line in a Ferlinghetti poem, 
"See it was like this when ..." which goes: "a couple 
of Papish cats is doing an Aztec two-step."  <P>

Thanks also to Joe Kulikauskas 
(kulikaus@shimoda.ena-east.ericsson.se) for 
reminding me of the song below and transcribing the lyrics.  
I like the line about "it is you and not he who is really the 
freak."  The song is called <I>The Persecution and Restoration of 
Dean Moriarty</I> and it was written by Rex Fowler.<P>

1.<BR>
Well I can't understand what is wrong with the man<BR>
Don't he know how he's acting was long ago banned?<BR>
Don't you think it's a shame, someone tell me his name<BR>
If we let him continue he may get out of hand.<P>

Well, look at him laughing and carrying on<BR>
Like a hydrogen manic or an organic bomb<BR>
He's alive like a child so terribly wild<BR>
He has way too much freedon, of course, he is wrong, is wrong, yeah.<P>

[chorus 1]<BR>
And he was born on the road in the month of July<BR>
And he'll live on the road till he sees fit to die<BR>
'Cause he's learned from the road how humanity cries<BR>
How society lies, he sees with more than his eyes.<P>

2.<BR>
Well won't you look at him running, don't he know how to walk?<BR>
He's just too damned cunning, you can tell by his talk<BR>
You can tell he is rude like a typical dude<BR>
If you want my opinion he belongs under lock.<P>

One look in his eyes and you know he's unsound<BR>
There's no way to faze him 'cause he's nobody's clown<BR>
He's as deep as the sea and he's equally free<BR>
That's why I fear him and hate him and wish he was down, was down, yeah.<P>

[chorus 2]<BR>
Whether riding the rails out of Denver,<BR>
Or bumming a friends' cigarettes,<BR>
He's asking them all to remember,<BR>
Making sure that they'll never forget.<P>

3.<BR>
So you're curious, friend, 'bout this man who I speak<BR>
For he tears you and scares you out of your sleep<BR>
I'm sure you will find, if you open your mind<BR>
It is you and not he who is really the freak.<P>

So relax for a moment as you would for your hobby<BR>
His beauty abounds in his mind and his body<BR>
He's like the setting sun's hues or the dust on his shoes<BR>
He's living he's naughty he's Dean Moriarty, yeah.<P>

[chorus 2]<BR>

4.<BR>
He may ride down the road at one hundred and ten<BR>
Exclaiming his thoughts about prisons and men<BR>
He may tell you his dreams, maybe something obscene<BR>
And you'll swear you've been through it but you don't know just when.<P>

He's like the dancing gold prairies that will never be mowed<BR>
Or the wind in the sail that's about to explode<BR>
He's like fire and rain bringing pleasure and pain<BR>
And he learned all he knows from the ways of the road.<P>

[chorus 1]<BR>

<H3>Eric Anderson</H3>

Eric Anderson is a folksinger whose career began in the sixties
and continues to the present day.  I saw him at a folk festival
about eight years ago, and thought he was pretty good.  Thanks to
James Holbrook (jho2@cableol.co.uk) for telling me about this 
song, "Ghosts Upon The Road," and sending me the lyrics.<P>

<I> <BLOCKQUOTE>
I was stranded up in Cambridge Mass it<BR>
was the winter of 64 before that in a torn-<BR>
down building up on Beacon Hill I made<BR>
my money mowing lawns that fall and <BR>
jukin in a band the air was full of energy<BR>
only a few could understand<P>

Now I was lucky in my building because the<BR>
city had forgot to board up all the doors and<BR>
windows and shut the electric off an abandoned <BR>
dog had earlier destroyed the first and second floors<BR>
I found some country records there but I had no stereo<BR>
but sometimes I'd hear noises in the night<P>

On the 3rd floor there I was livin by candlenight<BR>
crashed out in the corner of a room afraid to draw<BR>
attention I was eating cold out of cans later they<BR>
said I was living like a rat<P>

Now the crowd I hung out with well they were outcasts too<BR>
Suzie alone and pregnant with my best friend's kid<BR>
Johhny Boy just got thrown out of the local loony bin<BR>
and Brain was renting out apartments that didn't exist<BR>
then one night alone I wrote a song about something<BR>
that I knew about the black faced miners it was a tune<BR>
from a man named Blue<P>

Ghosts upon the road they were ghosts upon the road<BR>
just ghosts upon the road<P>

Soon I moved across the river and got a roommate right <BR>
off of Cambridge Ave Alfredo was from no man's land he<BR>
danced his car over the moon his eyes were full of Latin<BR>
smoke and his wall was full of knife holes he had a job as<BR>
a maitre'd and I didn't have enough to keep in cigarettes<BR>
his pockets were always lined and his bed was always full<BR>
my soul felt like an empty lot and people were hiding their<BR>
stash and stuff underneath their floorboards back then<BR>
everybody was paranoid of the cops and then there was Diana<BR>
she took me under her hat she's happily married with three<BR>
kids now so I won't go into that<P>

Ghosts upon the road they were ghosts upon the road<BR>
just ghosts upon the road<P>

Now the jungle war and politics was on everybody's mind<BR>
they rejected me on mental grounds so it was not my lot to serve<BR>
that August day on Whitehall street I ran into some post beat hippies<BR>
I'd known I must have looked so weird to them they only waved at me<BR>
I'd been lucky to have been advised by some higher sources that I'd <BR>
known and managed to keep the circles under my eyes I knew that fear<BR>
can make a man crazy even more than make him scared you didn't need<BR>
a bloodhound to know the smell of blood was in the air soon I was asked<BR>
to leave the place the rest were asked to stay both my head and I were<BR>
dressed like Holden Caulfield on that day<P>

But ridin the rails of subways was far safer than the time I tried<BR>
like takin matters into my own hands down on the Lower East Side<BR>
that summer's night on Avenue B he almost jumped off a six story roof<BR>
next time I got a piano but I fell in love too soon but sometimes<BR>
I'd hear noises in the night<P>

Ghosts upon the road they were ghosts upon the road<BR>
just ghosts upon the road<P>

It was then I knew that death was death that life was life<BR>
maybe there was an in between not just some French and Russian<BR>
novels or the love of a poet's life or the need to give everything<BR>
three had tried to kill me and three had saved my life life and death<BR>
were indistinguishable til death put an end to that I dreamed my life<BR>
would roll on forever like some great plain in the west my lovers I'd<BR>
count like billboards on ribbon route infinity cryin out Dean Moriarty<BR>
Sweet Marilyn here I come in our fast cars our rockin boots meet the <BR>
sons of the dharma bums til one went into the bathroom he took his belt<BR>
off and never came out and Melissa put one up inside the soft roof of <BR>
her mouth<P>

Ghosts upon the road they were ghosts upon the road<BR>
just ghosts upon the road<P>

Now and then I think about Rachel who I followed up some<BR>
steps and I think it was Georges Clemenceau who once said<BR>
that the highlight of making love first time was to watch a woman <BR>
from behind climbin up the stairway to her room but that was 1914<BR>
and now this was 14th Street in the Spanish neighborhood by the river<BR>
but it was long ago she said she took a lot of acid then but she ended<BR>
up besides many I knew ended up much worse and Ramblin Jack was wild<BR>
but Lowell Jack was first and I still shiver from the words but it's<BR>
these times I wonder when I'm all alone and I don't see you did I lose <BR>
my way or did you lose yours<P>

Ghosts upon the road they were ghosts upon the road<BR>
just ghosts upon the road<P>

<H3>Belle and Sebastian</H3>

A few people have told me about the Kerouac 
inspirations behind this new Scottish 
experimental folk-rock outfit.  Among 
other references, the song 
"Le Pastie De La Bourgeoisie" asks:

<I><BLOCKQUOTE>
Wouldn't you like to get away?<BR>
Kerouac's beckoning with open arms<BR>
And open fields of eucalyptus<BR>
Westward bound<P>

<H3>Soul Coughing</H3>

Everybody tells me I gotta get into this band.  Okay, I'll buy the
CD.<P>

<H3>Other Connections?</H3>

That's all I have for now; there's a lot I'm leaving out, I'm sure.  Please 
send me info about anything you think I should include.  I will be adding to 
this section occasionally, although I think there've been more and more
connections lately, including the Kerouac tribute CD "Kicks Joy Darkness,"
and if this craze continues I'm eventually going to have to either quit
my job and dedicate my life to keeping this page up to date, or just
give up, which is probably the better option. <P> 

In any case, I think the connection between the Beats 
and 1960's rock is an especially fascinating 
subject, especially with regard to three cities that had 'underground scenes'
around 1965-66, London, New York and San Francisco, and the three major
bands that arose from these scenes, Pink Floyd, the Velvet Underground and
the Dead.  Like I said up on the top of this page, I think there is a 
<I>lot</I> more to be said about this connection, and if nobody else finds 
the time to delve into this I think I eventually will.<P>

NOTE: despite the many connections between the Beats and rock 'n' roll, the
primary music associated with the Beat movement was 
<A HREF="../Topics/Jazz.html">jazz</A>.  There's also reason to suspect that
some of those guys occasionally tossed a classical album on the turntable.
Note this picture of 1010 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, where
Allen Ginsberg wrote 
'<A HREF="../Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>.'
It's a little hard to see, but the album on the shelf says "Mass In B Minor."
Probably Bach or Vivaldi or some shit like that.  Hey, you know those        
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Ivy League</A>
types.<P>
