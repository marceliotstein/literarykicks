<H1>Beat Topics: Jazz</H1>

I write most of this 'Literary Kicks' stuff myself.  But I don't know much
about jazz (I have a Pat Metheny album, does that count?), so I think you'll 
be in better hands reading 
<A HREF="../Topics/JanssenOnJazz.html">Mike Janssen's paper on Beats And Jazz</A>.<P>

Or, you could read an article called 
'<A HREF="http://www.dla.utexas.edu/depts/ams/Jazz/Jazz3/Noferi.htm">Jazz and the Beat Generation: The Musical Model in Literature</A>', 
or try 
<A HREF="../Topics/MilanaikPoem.html">a poem</A> called 'That Classic Jazz,'
which David Milanaik sent me, or check the pages Sean Daniel Singer
wrote me about jazz-influenced Beat poets
<A HREF="../People/TedJoans.html">Ted Joans</A> 
and 
<A HREF="../People/BobKaufman.html">Bob Kaufman</A>.<P>

Or we could just let old 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack</A>
tell us 
<A HREF="../Texts/RoadJazz.html">about it</A>
himself ... <P>
