<I><H3>THAT CLASSIC JAZZ</H3>
by David Milanaik<BR>
milanaik@princeton.edu<P>

sweet keys being stroked into<BR>
song rolling like blood from a<BR>
small wound easy, slow and<BR>
thick, rich like a dab of fudge<BR>
mellow as red wine<P>

the voice down and up like<BR>
crests of white cap rising<BR>
to pat the edge of a docked<BR>
boat and sinking to spring<BR>
again in a controlled tremble<BR>
easing into a breadth of silence<BR>
and back again like the face<BR>
of an old lover longed to be<BR>
seen again<P>
