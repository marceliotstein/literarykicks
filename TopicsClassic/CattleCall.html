<H3>My Audition for On The Road</H3>

<I>By Levi Asher</I><BR>
<I>February 1995</I><P>

<I>New York</I> Magazine said Francis Ford Coppola was holding an open 
casting call for all major parts in his upcoming film of 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>.'  
I thought: cool!  I'm not nearly extroverted enough to 
play Dean Moriarty, but I could handle being Sal Paradise.  I kinda 
look like my mental image of Sal -- well hey, he's fictional,
anybody can look like him if they want.<P>

The article gave a date (Saturday, February 4th) and a location 
(St. Paul's Church on 58th and Columbus).  I called the church for 
more information and was told to just show up at noon.  Sounded easy 
enough ... but on Friday (one day before the casting call) I saw 
a poster around Greenwich Village that gave the real instructions.  
To try out, I'd have to bring an 8x10 photograph and a cassette tape 
(non-returnable) containing a one-minute reading from a long list
of beat-related writers: Kerouac, Wolfe, Melville, Dos Passos, Proust,
Rimbaud, Ginsberg, Spengler, Burroughs, etc.  <P>

I have absolutely no acting experience, and I haven't the slightest idea 
how to read onto a tape in an "actor-ly" fashion.  What the fuck, I decided. 
I'll wing it.  First I called my sister Sharon, who wanted to go 
to the audition with me.  Sharon's really into Kerouac -- in fact she was 
the one who persuaded me to read him for the first time.  I told her about 
the 8x10 and the cassette tape and her reaction was the same as mine: 
oh shit.  But she agreed to do it.<P>

I decided to read a section from the first part of 'On The Road,' the passage
where Sal and his friend Eddie pass through Shelton, Nebraska.  First I
tried to get myself into a Kerouac frame-of-mind -- which means I got a 
little buzzed and paced around the bedroom scratching my head for a few 
minutes.  Then I hit the record button and read the two paragraphs straight 
through, no planning and no rehearsing.  Turned it off and, Kerouac-style, 
declared it a final draft -- no revisions or second thoughts allowed.  I took 
it into the living room and played it for my wife, who said it wasn't as 
bad as she thought it would be.  Praise!  Yes!<P>

Neither Sharon nor I had 8x10's, but like any good Webmaster I have my trusty
handheld photo scanner.  I scanned a photo of Sharon 'on the road' -- her 
then-boyfriend/now-husband took it during a cross-country trip, and here it 
is:

For myself, I chose a photo taken on the roof of 206 E. 7th Street, the 
apartment building where Kerouac and Ginsberg and Burroughs took some famous 
photos of each other (someday I'll write a page about the photos I took there).
I thought my picture might capture someone's attention because it was modeled
after a photo of Ginsberg -- here's the one of me:<P>

and here's the well-known Ginsberg photo taken forty years earlier from the
same roof:

I blew the scans up to full-page size and printed them on my HP DeskJet.  
Not exactly the finest quality, but hey we're talking Beat here.  <P>

Saturday morning I picked Sharon up at her place on the Upper West Side, and 
we listened to each other's tapes.  She'd gone through several books looking
for a good female bit to read, and settled on a letter Mardou Fox wrote to
Leo Percepied in 
'Subterraneans.'  
Her husband Jeff got inspired and played a jazz record (Dizzy Gillespie) 
in the background, and Sharon and Jeff were both really excited about the tape 
because there was a certain horn bit that coincided perfectly with the moment 
where Sharon/Mardou read the word "Oh ..." -- in fact they were so enamored of 
the tape they weren't sure they wanted to give it up, and we couldn't leave 
for the audition until they made a copy for them to keep.  Sharon's tape 
didn't look exactly professional -- she hadn't had a blank tape around, and 
just taped over a cassette of some female folksinger, Holly or Molly 
something ... I wondered what Coppola would think of me and Sharon, with our 
inkjet photographs and taped-over tapes.<P>

It hadn't occurred to me yet that Coppola might not want to pay a real lot
of attention to Sharon or me.  I'm stupid this way: I always underestimate
how many people will be interested in things I'm interested in.  I was 
expecting to find maybe 30 or 40 people there; I figured I'd get to bullshit
with Coppola and tell him how much I liked 'The Godfather' and suggest
a few camera angles for his scenes with Sal and Dean ... in short, I didn't
have a clue.  Because Sharon and I got there and there was a line of 
FIVE THOUSAND FUCKING PEOPLE STANDING IN THE FREEZING COLD OUTSIDE THE
CHURCH BITCHING ABOUT HOW LONG THEY'D BEEN WAITING.<P>

I'm not exaggerating about the number of people.  I had no idea how many 
desparate actors there were in New York City.  The church was on a long city 
block, and the line wound past the corner, all the way down the long end of the
block, into a parking garage (because it was cold), back out of the parking 
garage, then around to the far corner and halfway down the block again.
I'm not talking single-file either -- the line was four or five people 
deep.  <P>
                
I'd been expecting a lot of bookish beatnik/hippie types (like me) to show up, 
but the crowd was largely made up of professional or semi-professional 
actors, and they didn't seem particularly interested in or knowledgable
about the Beats.  They were mostly attractive and young, short-haired and
neatly dressed, and many of them carried glossy 8x10 headshots.  Sharon
and I started talking to the people around us, mainly to three people:<P>

<UL>
<LI>a 25-year-old brown-haired guy with a grunge-rock look.  Had read a few 
    pages of 'On The Road' and hated it: "What was all that about 
    dingledodies and burn, burn, burn ...?"  His grunge look was deceptive -- 
    he was rehearsing for an off-broadway play about Kurt Cobain, and had
    grown his hair for the part.  He showed me his photo and I was 
    surprised: he had the clean-cut conventional appearance of any 
    male lead in a soap opera.

<LI>19-year-old NYU student, female, who hadn't brought a tape or a 
    picture.  Never read Kerouac, perhaps never even heard of Kerouac.  Had 
    done some acting.  Had a sort of cute 50's look and could have played 
    Marylou, Dean's first wife.  Kept talking about how terrible she looked
    today, maybe hoping somebody would contradict her.

<LI>46-year-old slightly batty woman, extensive and mostly unsuccessful
    acting experience.  She and the pseudo-grunge guy found they knew
    a lot of the same industry people.  Talked a lot.  About five feet
    tall and slightly overweight.  She had read some Kerouac, and I asked 
    her what part she had in mind for herself.  She said "I don't know, 
    Camille?" which is Dean's beautiful 20-year-old second wife.  
    Uh ... yeah.  I guess you develop a really good imagination after 
    a few years in this business.
</UL>

There were many others, and we all got to know each other real well because 
we spent FOUR FUCKING HOURS standing out there.  It was freezing cold,
but in a way our mutual suffering brought us all together, and by the
end of the wait we all knew everything about each other.  It was kind of like
'A Chorus Line' where we each take turns telling our life stories, except
we didn't sing (well, one person did -- actors are so hammy).  <P>

Sharon had to go home after a couple hours (she just had her first baby
recently), but I was determined to make it inside.  The line moved 
slowly.  We entertained ourselves with jokes, coordinated jumping, 
coffee, cigarettes (I had three and I don't smoke).  It was all
kind of fun, although my toes got frozen stiff.  The psuedo-grunge guy 
and the girl from NYU were looking kinda chummy by the fourth hour.  I 
wonder if she'll still like him after he turns back into a soap star.<P>

We got in the door at six-thirty (we'd arrived at two).  They herded us 
into a basement auditorium in groups of three hundred, and passed us 
little pink slips of paper to write our personal statistics on.  
One of Coppola's assistants  explained that they'd be letting us 
up to the front one bunch at a time, and all we were to do was hand in
our slips, tapes and photos and say hello to Mr. Coppola.  They told us
to please not shake Mr. Coppola's hand, as he has a sore shoulder.  What 
about auditioning? we all wondered.  There was no audition, it turned out.  
We were to hand in our materials and let them look at us, and that was it. 
Perhaps they would make some sort of unspoken selection, but it was 
not clear how they would do this.  After the long cold wait, we were 
all a bit stunned and didn't know what to think of this.  The actors were
more annoyed than I was, since I was really there just for fun (for 
them it was business).  <P>

My bunch went up.  I handed in my tape and photo and slip, then moved
on to the table where Francis Ford Coppola was greeting everybody.  I 
spotted Allen Ginsberg sitting behind Coppola (I had a feeling he'd be 
there) and I thought of going up and speaking to him, but he looked 
tired, possibly even asleep behind those plastic goggle-glasses, and I
decided not to bother him.  Coppola seemed to be in a very good mood.  
Somebody handed him a trumpet (I don't know what the significance of
this is) and he played a few notes.  I was surprised how jovial, almost
goofy, he looked.  He actually resembles Allen Ginsberg, except that he's
younger and much heavier, so it was strange to see them both together 
in the same place.<P>

I happen to like Coppola a lot (he directed the 'Godfather' films, 
'Apocalypse Now' and 'The Outsiders,' in case you didn't know), and I
was kind of excited to meet him.  When it was my turn he actually reached
out and shook my hand, which surprised me because we'd been told 
that handshakes were a no-no.  He had BIG beefy hands.  I said, "I hope 
you'll make a great film" and he said "Yeah, well, we've got to get 
started," or something like that.  It was hard to concentrate with all
the other actors clamoring behind me.  I moved on.<P>

Well, that's the story of my first cattle-call.  It's been five days and 
nobody's called me back yet.  If I get called I'll let you all know.  But I 
feel kinda 'Hollywood' now anyway, just from the experience of hanging out 
with all those actors for a whole day.  So ta-ta for now (*kiss, kiss*).  
And I'd like to thank ... ah fuck it.<P>
