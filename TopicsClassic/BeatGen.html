The Beat Generation</H1>    

Like the French Impressionist artists of Paris, the Beat writers were a small 
group of close friends first, and a movement later.  The Beat Generation in 
literature comprised a relatively small number of writers, of which 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>, 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A> and 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> 
are the best known today.  All three met in the environs of
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>
in New York City in the mid-1940's, and they remained close friends,    
encouraging each other's individualistic writing efforts for more than ten 
years before publishers began to take their work seriously in the 
late 50's. <P>

The Beat Generation was not a bunch of hype like today's so-called 'Generation 
X'.  Where Generation X is supposed to encompass millions of people identified 
by age, the Beat Generation was a small group of adult writers, based in 
New York or the 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco Bay Area</A> 
and highly connected to the publishing industry. Supposedly, the name and 
phone number of virtually every Beat writer was in Allen Ginsberg's address 
book.  If Generation X is like Woodstock, the Beat Generation was like a small 
dark tavern at two in the morning, with a bunch of old 
<A HREF="../Topics/Jazz.html">jazz</A>
musicians jamming on stage and Jack Kerouac buying rounds at the bar. <P>

We think of the Beat Generation as a phenomenon of the 50's, but the term
was invented by Jack Kerouac in 1948 (for a discussion of
the origin of this and other labels, check out
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatEtymology.html">Lost, Beat and Hip</A>).  The phrase
was then introduced to the general public in 1952 when Kerouac's friend 
<A HREF="../People/JohnClellonHolmes.html">John Clellon Holmes</A>
wrote an article, 'This is the Beat Generation,' for the New York Times
Magazine (click 
<A HREF="../Texts/ThisIsBeatGen.html">here</A>
to read the complete original article).<P>

There's a lot of Beat-related material on the web.  Rather than 
list all the links in one page (what fun is that?), I try to 
sprinkle links throughout my pages.  A few good starting places 
are my
<A HREF="../News/BeatNews.html">Beat News</A> 
page, my new lists of 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Boards/viewBoard.jsp?forum=4">Beat-related films and TV shows</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Boards/viewBoard.jsp?forum=2">Beat Connections In Music</A>
(both of which you can finally contribute to), my list of 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatSources.html">books about the Beats</A>
(the sources of most of the info in Literary Kicks), 
my friend Sherri's extensive bibliography of
<A HREF="../Biblio/SherriBiblio.html">books by the Beats</A>
and finally my personal note, 
<A HREF="../Topics/WhyILikeTheBeats.html">Why I Like The Beats</A>.  <P>

Colin Pringle maintains a 
<A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/colinp/beats.htm">list of Beat links</A>
as part of his 
<A HREF="http://www.halcyon.com/colinp/bohemian.htm">Wild Bohemian Home Page</A>.  
<A HREF="http://www.vesuvio.com/">Vesuvio</A>,
a vintage Beat drinking spot in 
the North Beach section of 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>
has a cool site, but don't visit at work if you have a sound card -- it 
plays music (I found this out the hard way).
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/corduroy/">Bohemian Ink</A>
has a lot of good links to the kinds of writers we all like,
Michael Bowen's
<A HREF="http://www.beatscene.com/">Beat Scene</A> is
also good, and Rinaldo Rasa of Italy has created a self-titled
'<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/4840/thebeats.htm">Absolutely Shit-Kicking List</A>'
of just about every writer, poet, musician or general-purpose weirdo who
has ever been classified as 'beat'.
There are some great beat photography archives available online from
photographers like
<A HREF="http://www.jackmagazine.com/gallery/keenan.html">Larry Keenan</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.elsa.photo.net/Ginsberg.html">Elsa Dorfman</A> 
and
<A HREF="http://www.harryredl.com/">Harry Redl</A>.<P>

One beat site I recently ran into and enjoyed is 
<A HREF="http://www.3-cities.com/~geets/home.htm">How To Speak Hip</A>
by David Eads.  Another interesting one is 
<A HREF="http://www.boppin.com/">Brian Nation's site</A>.
Then there's 
Mary Sands' 
<A HREF="http://www.beatnews.org/">Beat Generation News</A>,
and 
<A HREF="http://www.beatcafe.com/">The Beat Cafe</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.rooknet.com/beatpage">The Beat Page</A>,
all of them admirably thorough and informative.
Veering off towards the less structurally logical, 
don't miss the inexplicable but fun 
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/cosmic/97dbr.html">Cosmic Baseball Association's Fantasy Beat Baseball Team</A>.<P> 

If you're looking for beat books, 
<A HREF="http://www.citylights.com/">City Lights</A> 
is the all-time classic Beat bookstore.
<A HREF="http://www.waterrowbooks.com">Water Row Books</A> of
Sudbury, Massachusetts is a
great place to find every Beat thing ever published.
<A HREF="http://www.kerouac.com">Fog City Fact and Fiction (Kerouac.com)</A> 
is also good, as are two outposts from London,
the 
<A HREF="http://www.compendium-books.com">Compendium Bookstore</A> 
and the 
<A HREF="http://www.beatbooks.com">Beatbooks Catalog</A>.
The library at Cal 
<A HREF="../Places/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</A>
has an awesome list of 
<A HREF="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/BeatGen.html">beat multimedia resources</A>.
You can find some good videotapes and audiotapes at 
<A HREF="http://www.mysticfire.com/">Mystic Fire Video</A>.
Also, 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/hanuman/">Hanuman Books</A>
has published some interesting, unusual small books by many beat authors 
(and my very talented ex-wife
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/">Meg</A>
put their site together!).  Ron Whitehead's 
<A HREF="http://www.NEOSOFT.com/~whtfld">White Fields Press</A>
has some similarly interesting beat stuff.<P>

There's also a usenet newsgroup called
<A HREF="news:alt.books.beatgeneration">alt.books.beatgeneration</A>
which is sometimes good.  From Summer 1995 to Spring 1998
there was an excellent internet mailing list called BEAT-L
which finally fell victim to a gigantic flame war and ceased to
exist; a new, more peaceful (we hope) mailing list called
SUBTERRANEANS was created to carry on, and you can read more
about this list 
<A HREF="http://www.bigtable.com/subterraneans.html">here</A>.<P>

Finally ...
If you've had enough of all this nonsense and just want to read 
some actual Beat texts, here's  
<A HREF="../Texts/BeatTextList.html">a few I typed up</A>.<P>
