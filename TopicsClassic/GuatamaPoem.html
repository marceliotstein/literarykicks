<I>A poem by T. H. Persinger 1994<BR>

seeing  allen ginsberg<BR>
rotting ginsberg<BR>
beat legend ginsberg<BR>
i wonder daily<BR>
if when i wake ginsberg will be dead ?<BR>
if he is dead when will i first hear of the passing of soul<BR>
allen ginsberg,<BR>
where are you now ?<BR>
allen ginsberg,<BR>
are you really living in an alley<BR>
with dead mother, meeting father,<BR>
not hungry or lonely<BR>
without kerouac or cassady ?<BR>
allen ginsberg,<BR>
I wonder,<BR>
allen ginsberg-<BR>
sunflower words of Blake and Whitman and french poets<BR>
mixed into giant revolutionary breath gasp mile long verse Howl.<BR>
allen ginsberg,<BR>
1960 song of america<BR>
You were afoot and light hearted<BR>
as you searched the way-<BR>
Are you still ?<P>

Ginsberg, as you leave radioactive planet earth<BR>
what do you think ?<BR>
what is your elegy of land crippled under weight ?<BR>
What ginsberg, what ?<P>

When you were young once, did you imagine<BR>
your life would amount to a couple cloth<BR>
bound volumes, influence refuted by masses,<BR>
excepted disciples, and you guru of modern poetry.<P>

Goodbye Ginsberg.<P>
