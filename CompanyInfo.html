<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/">Literary Kicks</A> is an online resource and gathering place devoted to alternative literature.  The site was founded in 1994 as a small collection of Beat Generation biographies and texts, and has since expanded in scope and focus to include a wide range of literary genres and movements including British Romanticism, French Symbolism, Haiku and Asian Poetry, the Harlem Renaissance, the Jazz Age, the postmodern writers of the 1960's and the transgressive scene of today.<P>

The site features hundreds of hyperlinked <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/articles.jsp">articles, author biographies and book reviews</A> contributed by members around the world.  Other core activities include a vibrant and highly active <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/index.jsp">community area</A>, an <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Visibility/index.html">advertising program</A> for small publishers and <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Events/index.html">live poetry gatherings</A> in New York City and elsewhere.<P>

LitKicks has been nominated for a Webby Award and featured on numerous television and radio shows.  The site has a dedicated academic following including both professors and college students, and maintains a large and culturally diverse worldwide general audience.  Poems from the <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/board.jsp?what=ActionPoetry">Action Poetry</A> board were selected by the United States Library of Congress in 2001 for their September 11 archive.  Traffic as of August 2002 was 1.2 million pageviews/month (78,000 unique visitors). <P>

LitKicks is planning a series of new programs in conjunction with the website, and is seeking partners, advisors and investors interested in being part of an exciting and rewarding creative process.
