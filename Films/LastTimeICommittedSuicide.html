<H1>The Last Time I Committed Suicide</H1>

As the world was waiting for Francis Ford Coppola to 
get busy filming his much-hyped and still-unmade version of
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>',
an unknown writer/director named Stephen Kay was quietly 
working on his own movie about the 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>
legend.  "The Last Time I Committed Suicide" is based
on a couple of letters Neal wrote to 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
about his sexual escapades when he was a horny young
(19) stud in
<A HREF="../Places/Denver.html">Denver</A>.<P>

The film is stronger on atmosphere and style than on
plot.  Neal is involved with a series of women --
one is suicidal, and another is underage and eager
as hell to get into Neal's pants, but unfortunately
has a well-connected mother with a hotline into the
Denver police force.  It's a sort of good-humored
story about being hassled and being in love, and 
it doesn't go much deeper than a typical Eagles
song about the same subject ("... seven women on
my mind, one that wants to own me, two that want
to stone me, one says she's a friend of mine ...").<P>

I enjoyed the film but wasn't knocked out.  The most
notable thing about it is probably the slick editing, which
makes creative use of black-and-white, color, stop
motion, etc., all blended into an easy-going, fast-moving,
almost MTV-like whole.  This film will not tax your brain.<P>

Keanu Reeves is surprisingly bland as a 
friend of Neal's who turns out to be kind of creepy.
The guy who plays Neal does a good job of mimicking
the famous Neal voice and look, and is on the whole
more convincing than Nick Nolte was in 
'<A HREF="../Films/HeartBeat.html">Heart Beat</A>'.
I also thought the actor who represents the young
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
was passable.  Jack Kerouac, interestingly, is not
represented at all in the film.<P>

Neal Cassady's letters to Kerouac were said to
have had a big impact on Kerouac's eventual writing style.
An example of a Cassady letter -- though not one of the
letters this film was based on -- is
