John Antonelli's documentary on the life and writings of 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
was released in 1985.  It starts and ends with footage of 
Kerouac reading from 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On the Road</A>'
and 
'Visions of Cody'
on the Tonight Show with Steve Allen.  To see him in person
is a revelation.  He looks and sounds more like James Dean than 
you'd think; his intelligence is evident in his face, and his 
shyness is as well.  "Are you nervous?" Steve Allen asks him, and
the way he says "Naw" makes it clear that he is much more nervous
than he wants to be.<P>

The film follows Kerouac's biography, and scenes from his life are acted 
out, sometimes with voice-overs from his novels.  I like the young actor who
plays Kerouac.  For some reasons Kerouac is portrayed as either doofy-looking 
or brown-haired in films like
'<A HREF="../Films/NakedLunchFilm.html">Naked Lunch</A>'
and 
'<A HREF="../Films/HeartBeat.html">Heart Beat</A>'
and I was glad that this filmmaker got the image right: the actor is
handsome and sort of sad-looking, and has black hair.  My favorite image here 
is probably that of the young writer returning to Lowell on a big armchair 
mounted on the back of a pickup truck.  <P>

There's about a minute of a bloated and drunk Kerouac on William F. Buckley's
TV show.  Buckley asks Kerouac an inflammatory question (whether he inspired 
the hippies) and gets the kind of response he wanted: Kerouac insults 
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</A>,
huffs and puffs, and declares himself a Catholic.  <P>

The only problem is, there's not enough actual footage.  The two TV clips
I described are about all there is, and I want to see more.  There are also
interviews with Kerouac's first wife Edie Parker, 
<A HREF="../People/HerbertHuncke.html">Herbert Huncke</A>, 
Robert Creeley,
a priest who knew Kerouac as a child, 
and others.<P>
