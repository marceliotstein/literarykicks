<H1>The Beats: An Existential Comedy</H1>

Directed by Philomene Long, 1980. <P>

This is a quirky semi-documentary that captures very well the
mood of a certain Late Beat Period moment sometime after
Beat had turned into Beatnik but before Beatnik turned into 
Hippie.  Groucho Marx interviews a scruffy looking Venice Beach
poet on the "You Bet Your Life" TV show and asks "are you a beatnik?"
(the poet says no, but we all know this means yes).  There're also
good poetic moments with

reading a cute poem about a dog,

lighting incense and chanting, and so forth.  <P>

$79.95 is a bit expensive for this (or any) video, but it's
worth seeing.  Check out
