<H1>Drugstore Cowboy</H1>

A Film by Gus Van Sant<BR>
Released 1989<P>

This film was a lot of fun.  It's a portrait of a grouchy young
speed freak (Matt Dillon) and his gang of three.  His wife (Kelly Lynch) 
is even more attached to dope than he is, and the 
other young man and woman are enthusiastic but not very savvy.  The 
film moves quickly and captures effectively the chaotic pace of
young people who choose the criminal lifestyle. By the end one
character has sought redemption, one is no longer around, and two
have begun sleeping together.  That's all I'll give away.<P>

<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>
shows up towards the end as an old drug-addicted priest who knows
more about dope than anybody else in Portland.  He's wonderful in
this role; he plays himself, basically, so it's mustn't have been very
hard for him.  He talks in a slow heavy midwestern drawl 
and the comical effect of this thin old man with his hat 
and cane and dead-fish gaze is wonderful.  It's easy to 
see why his public readings in the Sixties and Seventies were such a hit.<P>

Gus Van Sant went on to direct 'My Own Private Idaho' and 'Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues', the former titled after a B-52's song, the
latter adapted from the Tom Robbins novel.  I've heard Burroughs is 
in 'Cowgirls' too (I didn't see it).  <P>
