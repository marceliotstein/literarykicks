<H1>Wild At Heart</H1>

Directed by David Lynch<BR>
Released 1990<P>

This is a Beat-related film because it was based on the novel
by Barry Gifford, who co-wrote the 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac</A>
oral biography 'Jack's Book' (see 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatSources.html">Books About The Beats</A>).<P>

You can see the Kerouac influence in the story, which involves Laura
Dern and Nicholas Cage travelling across America.  I love David Lynch,
but to me this wasn't as effective as other Lynch films like 'Blue
Velvet' and 'Eraserhead.'  Worth watching, though.  <P>
