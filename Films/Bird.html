This is a thoughtful biography of Charlie Parker, who seemed
to be 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>'s
favorite jazz musician.  Kerouac wrote about many jazz legends
(see an example 
<A HREF="../Topics/Jazz.html">here</A>)
but seemed to worship Charlie Parker with a unique fervor.  Many
of the choruses in Kerouac's poetry work 
'Mexico City Blues' 
are explicitly about him.<P>
