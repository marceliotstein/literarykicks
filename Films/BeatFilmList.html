This is a list of all the films I can think of with any sort
of substantial connection to the Beat writers.  Some of the
connections are obvious, others subtle; some connections exist
perhaps only in my own mind.  <P>

NOTE: I'm afraid I've fallen far behind in adding stuff to this page.
Since the web has taken over my life I really don't have much time
to rent videos, and I don't like to write about films I haven't seen.
Among the films I know I'm delinquent on covering here: "Chappaqua",
"Shadows," "Buckets of Blood," "Home of the Brave," etc. etc.
Someday I'll get to all of this, I promise!<P>

<H3>Other Connections</H3>

Any film by James Dean or Marlon Brando, especially 'Rebel Without A Cause' 
(Dean) or 'The Wild One' (Brando) is beat-related.<P>

I occassionally get mail asking about the status of the
Francis Ford Coppola film of 'On The Road,' which I
<A HREF="../Topics/CattleCall.html">auditioned for</A> 
in February 1995.  As of June 1997 the project is still in
cold storage; Coppola has not actually announced that he has abandoned
it, but it seems doubtful that the film will get made in the near 
future.  Check my 
<A HREF="../News/BeatNews.html">Beat News</A>
page for future updates, if there are any.<P>

Finally, one of the best collections of original Beat-related films 
and documentaries for sale is at 
<A HREF="http://www.mysticfire.com/">Mystic Fire Videos</A>.  
Among the available films are "Fried Shoes, Cooked Diamonds," a 
documentary about a Beat gathering at the Naropa Institute, and
a number of experimental works by William S. Burroughs. Hard-to-find 
videos like "Pull My Daisy" are also available at online Beat
bookstores like 
<A HREF="http://www.waterrowbooks.com">Water Row</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.kerouac.com">Fog City Fact and Fiction</A>.<P>

I hope to write more about many more Beat films when 
I finally find some free time!<P>
