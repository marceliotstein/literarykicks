As for Beat films, one you can definitely put on is Heaven and Earth 
Magic, directed by Harry Smith. Harry Smith is either a genius, a nut or 
both, because this is one of the most fucked-up movies I've ever seen. I 
actually own a copy, because it's worth having. It's essentially 
collage-art animation, sort of reminiscent of Max Ernst's Surrealist 
collage novels, but much more stark and minimalist. The entire soundtrack 
is nothing but sound effects. It's supposedly a parable for 
civilization's evolution or something, but I'm not sure how. Still, it's 
worth seeing. The tie-in is that Ginsberg and Harry Smith were pals, and 
there's a pretty neat picture of Smith pouring milk in Ginsberg's 
recently released 'Snapshot Poetics.'
