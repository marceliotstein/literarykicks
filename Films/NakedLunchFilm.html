<H1>Naked Lunch: The Film</H1>

There is a common misconception that this is based on the 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>
novel of the same name.  Actually it's a semi-fantasy based on Burroughs'
life during the period that he was writing this novel, but not on
<A HREF="../Books/NakedLunch.html">the novel itself</A>.  
Peter Weller (who is good at playing robotic characters; he
was RoboCop) plays a character named Will Lee, who represents Burroughs 
(Lee is Burroughs' mother's maiden name, and he used this pseudonym when 
'<A HREF="../Books/Junky.html">Junky</A>'
was published).<P>

Now that that's been cleared up: I liked this film very much.  David
Cronenberg directed it, and he was the one who did that incredible 
remake of 'The Fly' with Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis.  I didn't think
'Naked Lunch' delivered as much as 'The Fly,' but I admire Cronenberg
more than ever for making this challenging and uncommercial film, and
I found certain images in it brilliant. <P>

There's the running bit, for instance, about typewriters coming to life
as weird orgasmic insect-creatures who get sexually aroused when written 
well on.  Will Lee and the character representing 
<A HREF="../People/PaulBowles.html">Paul Bowles</A>
are very possessive about their respective typewriters.  Lee uses a 
Clark-Nova, Bowles uses a Martinelli, and one day Lee's Clark-Nova
violently dismembers Bowles' Martinelli in a fit of jealousy.  Bowles then
claims Burroughs' Clark-Nova as his own, and when the Clark-Nova tries to 
run away it slams into a closed door with the sound of a carriage bar 
ringing.  <P>

The film starts with Lee/Burroughs working as an exterminator (which
he did for a brief time).  Characters representing 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> and 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
tell Lee/Burroughs that his wife 
<A HREF="../People/JoanVollmerAdams.html">Joan</A>
has been shooting up his bug powder.  Soon the real-life
tragedy in which Burroughs accidentally shoots Joan takes place
(though here in New York instead of 
<A HREF="../Places/Mexico.html">Mexico</A>),
and Lee/Burroughs escapes to 
<A HREF="../Places/Tangier.html">Tangier</A>.  There he confronts
a universe of insect-filled nightmares, disgusting desires and secret 
plots.<P>

I could go on about what I think Cronenberg is trying to say with all
this, and maybe I'll revisit this someday and do so.  For now I'll just
say that this is a thought-provoking and worthy film, though I don't
see how somebody without a previous knowledge of Burroughs' life would
be able to get much out of it.<P>
