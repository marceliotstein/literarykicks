An Animated Film by Ralph Bakshi<BR>
Released 1981<P>

This is a favorite film of mine.  It's animated in the same style as
other Bakshi films like 'Fritz the Cat' and 'Heavy Traffic.'  The 
film/media establishment doesn't know exactly what to think of Bakshi, but
I love his work.  'Fritz the Cat' was brilliant but extremely offensive.  I 
prefer this much more politically correct work, which spans the lives of
four generations of Jewish-American musicians.  <P>

It starts with a gentle-souled vaudevillian, whose silent piano-playing son 
dies during Second World War.  This morose character leaves behind a 
rebellious son who hears an

figure reading

in a bar.  His goody-two-shoes friend runs scared, but he is smitten and 
takes off on an

trip to
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>,      
where he falls in with a Jefferson-Airplane-like Haight-Ashbury band.  
Their scene falls apart, leaving him with nothing.  He wanders to New
York and meets the son he sired (though they don't know this) during a
night in Kansas as he was crossing the country.  This boy goes on to be
a punk star.  <P>

What I like best about the movie is the truthfulness and sadness of everything
that happens to these people.  Bakshi is a talented and underrated 
filmmaker, and he did another work with more Official Beat Content: the short
live action TV film

Harvey Keitel.<P>
