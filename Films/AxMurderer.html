<H1>So I Married An Ax Murderer</H1>

I think Mike Myers is great.  'Wayne's World' was definitely his best, but 
this film was very good too.  I think it probably would have been more popular
if it didn't have such a dumb title.<P>

You're probably wondering why this is a Beat-related film.  This is a pretty 
weak connection, but the film opens with a shot of Jack Kerouac Street in
North Beach, the old Beat center of

Mike Myers does a poetry bit at what seems to be a neo-beat coffee bar there, 
but he actually sounds more like Frank Sinatra than like a beatnik, so the
moment doesn't exactly work.  Anyway, there are good things in this film.<P>
