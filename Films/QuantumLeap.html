If you've never seen Quantum Leap, the whole point is that some
guy is stuck tripping through time, transporting from one era to 
another, and usually solving some important problem with each trip.
During one episode, the main character leaps into the middle of an
affair involving a doe-eyed girl who wants to go 'on the road' like
her favorite writer 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> 
and the girl's nasty biker boyfriend, who prefers the novels of Evelyn 
Waugh -- no I'm just kidding about that last part.  Anyway, Kerouac himself
turns up and gives a speech that makes everything all right in time
for the Lemon-Freshened Clorox commercial.  <P>

This series is actually not too bad.  My wife likes it more than I do.  
The best thing about it is probably Dean Stockwell, who you might remember 
as Ben the demented weirdo (the other one besides Frank Booth) in 'Blue 
Velvet'.  He's in this show as a guy who helps the time-traveller get through 
each situation.  In this episode, Stockwell makes a speech of his own about 
what Kerouac means to him, and I like what he says (I also bet, 
knowing something about Stockwell, that he improvised this bit).  As
for the actor who plays Kerouac, he looks much too scrawny but has
the voice down pretty well.  Also, since the show seems to take place
during Kerouac's

period, he's not nearly drunk enough. <P>
