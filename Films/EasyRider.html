<H1>Easy Rider</H1>

Released 1969<P>

This is a Beat film by analogy.  Two guys go 
<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">on the road</A> 
in search of the real America.  Their immediate purpose is to reach 
the Mardi Gras in      
New Orleans
and complete a drug deal.  Jack Nicholson became famous for his great
bit as a small-town lawyer sympathetic to the two hippies.  <P>

Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda play the two guys.  A bit more OBC 
(Official Beat Content): one of the writers was 
<A HREF="../People/TerrySouthern.html">Terry Southern</A>, 
one of the

 of the Sixties.  <P>

And an interesting bit of trivia : Toni Basil, familiar to anyone who
like me watched MTV in the early eighties ("Oh Mickey you're so fine 
you blow my mind hey Mickey" -- great stuff) plays (I think I've got
this right) a prostitute in New Orleans.  I'm not sure about who she 
plays actually -- I'll try to watch this again soon -- but it's 
definitely her. <P>
