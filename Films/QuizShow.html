<H1>Quiz Show</H1>

The father of Charles Van Doren, the contestant who is fed correct answers
to keep him winning on 'Twenty-One,' was Mark Van Doren, an important
literary figure who, as a professor at 
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>,
encouraged student
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
to pursue a writing career, and also helped Ginsberg's friend
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>
make connections in the publishing industry.<P>

Mark Van Doren also compiled and wrote the introduction for 'The Whitman
Reader,' a popular collection of writings by  
<A HREF="../People/WaltWhitman.html">Walt Whitman</A>.<P>

The film is largely about the conflict between the polished (but phony)
refinement of the pseudo-genius Charles Van Doren, contrasted with the
slobby, nerdy true genius of the working class Queens native 
played by John Torturro, who he displaces as quiz-show champion.  
I liked this film fairly well, but I resent the implication
that people from
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn">Queens</A>
are slobby nerds.<P>
