A Short Film by Ralph Bakshi<P>

I found this one in the Museum of Broadcasting archives in New York
City while trying (unsuccessfully) to find 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac's</A>
appearances on the Steve Allen and William F. Buckley shows.  This is a short
film shown as part of some experimental package; I don't remember the
exact context but it was some Channel 13 kind of thing.  <P>

Ralph Bakshi is a favorite director of mine (he did 'Fritz The Cat' and
'<A HREF="../Films/AmericanPop.html">American Pop</A>'), so I was pretty
excited to find this, especially because it was about an aging Beat-wannabe 
and included actors playing Kerouac and 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A>.  
I checked out the videotape and watched it on the little 
museum monitor (which is what you do at the MOB).  I liked it.  
Harvey Keitel plays a morose, lonely old
hipster whose life hasn't developed into much of anything since the age
of Kerouac.  There's not much story beyond that; nor does there need to be. 
We see an actor (who actually doesn't look much like Kerouac, but dresses 
in Kerouac-style flannel shirts) simulating a Kerouac poetry reading in a 
nightclub.  There's one very affecting shot of Neal Cassady: Keitel says
something about the death of Kerouac's 'Denver friend,' and we see Cassady
falling to his knees on that legendary train yard, yelling "This Ain't 
Bebop!"  Which is, I suppose, the message of this film.  <P>
