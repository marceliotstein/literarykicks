<H1>The Beat Generation</H1>

This film was made by MGM in 1959.  It starred Steve Cochran and Mamie van 
Doren, and Jackie Coogan appeared in it as well. The director was
Albert Zugsmith.<P>

I've never seen it, and I wish I could find a copy.  I bet it's pretty
corny, and it'd probably be a lot of fun to watch.<P>
