<H1>The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg</H1>

Produced and Directed by Jerry Aronson<P>

This is a wonderful, affectionate documentary about 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>, 
created with Ginsberg's help in the early nineties.<P>

We start with dueling talk show clips -- a bemused
and friendly Dick Cavett interviewing Ginsberg in the late 
70's, and a smug, hostile William F. Buckley inquisiting
a younger Ginsberg in the late
60's.  These clips recur through the film, nicely framing 
it, and by the end Ginsberg has even opened up a warm
spot in Buckley's chilly heart by reciting "A Wales 
Visitation" -- or at least this appears to be the case.
Buckley then even succeeds in coaxing a visible and rare flash
of anger from Allen by cutting into his dreamy
vision of world peace with "It's just that your politics
are very naive" (or something like that).  Fascinating
exchanges, over all.<P>

This film also covers Ginsberg's traumatic childhood
with his insane mother through photographs and family
interviews.  It's good that this material is covered,
though we miss the harrowing details Allen provided 
himself in the poem 
"<A HREF="../Poems/Kaddish.html">Kaddish</A>."
We see uplifting shots of the later, famous
Ginsberg sharing a poetry stage with his father,
and this is an especially nice touch.<P>

There is only a minimal amount of material about 
Ginsberg's seminal Beat years in New York City
and 
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>,
but there is a good amount of stuff from the later
hippie years, especially including footage from
the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention and the
later No-Nukes protest near the Rocky Flats 
nuclear plant.  We also see a few glimpses of
<A HREF="../Places/Naropa.html">Naropa</A>.<P>

Overall the film is inspiring and well-worth seeing.
An independent production mostly available on video, 
Jerry Aronson created it as a labor of love, and you will
be supporting his earnest effort as well as edifying
and entertaining yourself if you purchase a copy 
from First Run Features by calling 1-800-488-6552
for a reasonable $29.95. <P>
