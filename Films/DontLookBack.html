A Film by D. A. Pennebaker<BR>
Released 1967<P>

There's more material on this film at John Howell's  
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/employees/howells/dylan.html">Dylan Web Site</A>.  
I mention it here mainly for the presence of 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>, who
was also present during the filming of Dylan's 
'<A HREF="../Films/RenaldoAndClara.html">Renaldo And Clara</A>.'<P>
He's hanging out in the alley during the famous clip of 'Subterranean
Homesick Blues,' an early music video, which starts the film.  <P>

It's an excellent film showing a surprisingly unfriendly Dylan at the
height of his Sixties fame.  He's touring in London and demonstrating
that he can be even nastier to dumb fans and dull reporters than anyone
would have imagined. At the same time he's performing extraordinarily
sensitive and literary acoustic material on stage.  Director Pennebaker
emphasizes this contradiction, allowing it to become the center of the 
film. <P>

The recent Tim Robbins film 'Bob Roberts' makes numerous references to 
'Don't Look Back.'  It's my personal theory, by the way, that Madonna's 
surprisingly interesting film 'Truth or Dare' was inspired by 'Don't Look
Back' as well.<P>
