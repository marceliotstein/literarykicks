<H1>The Subterraneans</H1>
 
Released June, 1960<BR>
Based on the novel by 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A><P>

I'd really like to see this film.  From what I've heard it's
a horrific attempt to translate the Beat mystique into 
Hollywood product.  George Peppard (later of 'A-Team') plays
the character based on Kerouac, Jim Hutton is 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>,
and Roddy McDowall (of 'Planet of the Apes') is
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A>.<P>

Most incredibly, the black girl who the Kerouac and Corso 
characters fight over is played by Leslie Caron ('Gigi') who
is, well, um ... she's white.  There goes the interracial
aspect.  <P>

The jazz soundtrack was supplied by Andre Previn.  I hope to 
find a way to see this film.  Sometimes there's nothing as much
fun as a really, really bad movie.  From what I hear, this is one.<P>
