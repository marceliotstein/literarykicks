<H1>Heart Beat</H1>

Released 1980<P>

For a long time I avoided seeing this film because I heard it 
sucked.  Then I decided it was my responsibility as the creator
of Literary Kicks to see it.  You know what?  It sucked.<P>

It's not horrible, just disappointing, because this was the 
first major film about the legend of
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>.  
and 
<A HREF="../People/NealCassady.html">Neal Cassady</A> 
and it should have been better.
It's based on 
<A HREF="../People/CarolynCassady.html">Carolyn Cassady</A>'s
memoir of the same name (she was Neal's wife and Jack's close friend).  
Sissy Spacek plays Carolyn, Nick Nolte is Neal, Ray Sharkey is 
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>   
and John Heard is Kerouac.  Heard is actually not that bad as
Kerouac.  He portrays the character as depressed and 
tormented, perhaps overly so, but I didn't object very strongly
to this.  Nolte, on the other hand, is all wrong for Neal Cassady.
Nolte moves slowly and thoughtfully and speaks with a menacing,
sneering drawl.  This isn't just how Nolte acts in this movie -- it's
how he acts in all movies (and in some it works well, like in the
segment Scorsese directed for "New York Stories", where Nolte
played the painter infatuated with Roseanne Arquette).  But this
approach negates the essence of Neal Cassady, who was (from all accounts)
fast-moving, fast-talking, and extremely friendly -- not at
all threatening or surly -- in his social demeanor. <P>

The portrayal of Ginsberg is a cruel hatchet job -- if the real
Ginsberg was anything like this, he would not be a famous poet, and
he would have no friends.  <P>

The film covers the early day's of the Jack/Neal/Carolyn circle in 
the 40's, continues through the rise of the Beat fad in the late 50's 
and ends with a shot of a lost lonely Neal driving 
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey</A>'s
bus in the 60's.  This last shot is supposed to be a sad moment?  Maybe
it was for Carolyn -- but from every other account of this
legendary bus trip, they were all having a friggin' blast!<P>
