<H1>The Beatniks</H1>

In 1960, when the 
<A HREF="../Films/SubterraneansFilm.html">Subterraneans</A>
film came out, another film called 'The Beatniks' was also released.  It was
directed by Paul Frees (who would go on to be the voice of Boris Badanov and
Cap'n Crunch).  <P>

I'd love a copy of this film if anybody knows where to get one.<P>
