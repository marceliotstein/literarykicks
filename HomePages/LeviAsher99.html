I once spent a lot of time trying to turn into a hip young novelist.<P>

It was the 80's, the age of Reagan, and also the age of Ann Beattie, Jay
McInerney, Raymond Carver and Tama Janowitz.  I wanted to be one of
them.  I was in my early 20's, just out of college, and living in my
parent's house on Long Island, working a mundane job as a software
developer.  In an effort to save my disastrous life, I signed up for a
nighttime writing workshop at Barnard (a snooty college in uptown
Manhattan near Columbia) taught by a semi-famous literary novelist who
lived on the Upper West Side -- a thin and wiry woman with frizzy hair
and owl glasses (but she wasn't Joyce Carol Oates).<P>

The workshops consisted mostly of critiques; three students would read a
story or poem each night, and the rest of the class would invariably
tear it apart.  I didn't even mind the sheer violence of this as much as
I minded the fact that the attacks tended to be cowardly and
ineffective.  Nobody would say straight out whether they liked a piece
or not; it was all indirect and implied and insinuational.  I remember
one time a woman read a prospective magazine article about her
experience raising a retarded daughter, and somebody objected to her use
of the word "lemon yellow" to describe a banana, because it would be
more correct to describe it as "banana yellow."
Then the entire class erupted into an argument about this, and we never
recovered from the argument, and the woman never found out if her piece
was any good (in fact, it was).<P>

A few times I tried to raise a hand to insert myself into the maelstrom,
but I didn't exactly feel comfortable speaking up in this crowd, and
every time I tried to say something the other writers squinted nastily
at me because they could tell by my clothes and my voice that I was just
a bridge-and-tunnel Long Island kid, not a hip Manhattanite like them. 
I didn't feel comfortable in general with most of the students there,
and when it came my turn to read I was expecting the worst.<P>

I was workshopping a novel I'd been working on for years, a fictional
piece about a lonely depressed kid who lives with his parents on Long
Island.  I began reading the latest draft of my first chapter, and as I
read it a strange thing started to happen.  Looking down at the paper as
I stutteringly recited, I somehow sensed from an ambient feeling in the
room that the class was getting what I was saying, and I looked up from
my paper and I could see from their faces that they actually were.  They
were looking sad at the sad parts, nodding their heads in recognition at
the poignant parts, and not even getting all bent out of shape when I
said "fuck" or quoted the Ramones.  I reached the end of the piece and
the class erupted in applause (which virtually never happened in this
workshop, there was usually no applause at all) and then afterwards
people gathered around me saying "How do you write so well?" and "I love
the part where ...!"  I was in a pretty happy mood that night.<P>

A few weeks later the teacher told me she'd like her agent to read my
novel.  Her agent was a high-powered top literary name who also
represented, weirdly enough, Michael Jackson and Jackie O.  The agent
read my novel, and guess what?  She hated it.  Or not exactly hated it
-- in fact she called me into her office for a private meeting and said
she liked it, except that my use of present tense was distracting, my
main character was a cipher, and the whole thing needed a lot of
cutting.  On the plus side, she said she'd liked the part where the
couple finally had sex, and she also said she thought I had talent and
would like to read my next work.  "Would you read this one again if I
changed the present tense to past?" I said, totally pushing my luck. 
She said we'd do lunch.<P>

I tried to apply her suggestions.  I changed the present tense to past,
and worked hard to fix the problem of the main character being a cipher
(much of the hard work here involved figuring out what the fuck"cipher"
meant, since I had no idea, and in fact I never even really found out). 
I cut the novel from 365 pages to 273, and gave it a new title which I
didn't even like as much as the old title, except it sounded catchier,
and then I decided to try out the new version at a different writing
workshop, this one at the New School on 12th Street in the Village,
taught by a male novelist in a wheelchair who lived on the Upper West
Side.  I read the latest version of my first chapter to the class, and
they liked it and said nice things, but somehow I sensed that they
didn't even like it as much as the earlier class had liked it, which
meant my improvements had made it worse instead of better.  I was
furious when I got home.<P>

The next day I decided to try an experiment.  I got shit-faced on a
bottle of Pina Colada mix, locked myself in my bedroom, and started
rewriting the entire novel from scratch, purely from memory, and the
rule was that I couldn't look at any of my previous words.  It was wild.
 I ended up doing this for four days straight -- going to work during
the day, then going home and locking myself back in my room, and I
produced a completely new version of the same novel and read a section
from the middle to my class the next time my turn came.  But even as I
began reading it, I had a scary feeling that my experiment hadn't
worked, that instead of producing a miraculous spontaneous work I'd only
managed to destroy the natural fiber that had held my work together in
the first place, and I was right, because the class didn't get what I
was trying to do at all.  They didn't think the funny parts were funny
or understand that the sad parts were sad.  It was a horrible disaster
for me.  Back at work, I considered giving up my dreams of being a
writer, and almost resolved to stop try and get used to the idea of
living my life as an un-creative, unknown software developer on Long
Island.  <P>

But I gathered together my courage, and I decided to take both versions
of the novel and combine them into one super-powered version, and I
changed the fucking thing <I>back</I> to present tense, because I still
like present tense better.  I wanted to preserve whatever was in the
first version that that class had liked so much, even though when I
looked back at those words now they seemed precious and arch.  But I
persevered, and I spent two and a half years working on the final
version of the novel.  I tried to be incredibly economical and
self-critical, removing or fixing every single word and thought and
characterization that I didn't think was completely true and pure and
perfect, and after two and a half years I had reduced it the size of a
novella, 91 pages, and then I signed up for another writing workshop,
this one at NYU taught by a young guy who always wore bright red and
blue striped sweaters and had furry black hair and a moustache and
looked like he should have gotten a job as a TV film critic.  I read the
first chapter -- which in this new shorter version was the equivalent of
four chapters in the first version -- and the class pretended to like
it, because I think they somehow sensed that it was important to me that
they liked it, and so they said it was "spare" and "economical" and
"intelligent".<P>

I knew it was a flop, an even worse flop than the one before.  Anyway,
it was too short to publish as a novel now anyway, and I decided after
all this work I was at least going to squeeze a goddamn short story out
of the fucking thing, so I  cut even more out of it until it was short
enough to submit to literary journals, and then I sent it out, and it
got rejected everywhere I sent it.<P>

I didn't come out of this semi-insane state of mind until I reached my
early 30's, when I started getting involved with various proto-literary
communities on the internet and found this environment infinitely more
natural, more organic and real and satisfying.  The final time I took a
workshop was in 1993, and I remember by this time only getting angry at
all  the inane, ridiculous comments the students made when they
critiqued.  Once an 80-year-old man came shuffling slowly in his walker
to hand his story up to the teacher, because the old man's lungs were 
too weak for him to read it himself, and the story was brilliant.  It
was a comic piece about his life as a homosexual hustler in the 1940's
around Times Square, and how he used to sleep under the Williamsburg
Bridge and shoot junk and steal things from stores.  I was the only one
who liked it.  The rest of the class smothered it with stale
marshmallows.  Like "I thought the sentence about the sun rising over
the smelly Hudson was kind of evocative."  Or "It's a good first draft,
but now you have to figure out what you're trying to say."  Or the old
lady with the knitting needles  who had to pipe up with "Are you sure
it's a good idea to  say 'sucking his cock' if you want to get it
published?" and everybody could just tell that she was only asking the
question because it was her lifelong ambition to say 'sucking his cock'
in front of a large group of strangers.<P>

At least nobody said "Show, don't tell."<P>

Looking back on my desparate years, I realize now that I was suffering
from the literary  equivalent of anorexia.  I was trying to make my
writing smaller and smaller, perfecter and perfecter, in the hope that
it would  finally be so small that nothing bad could possibly be left in
it.  My writing had become stublike and twisted and impossible to love,
and I didn't even love it  myself by the end.  <P>

Just what a young writer needs, a roomful of super-egos.   Really ...
writers don't need people spelling out the reasons they hate us.  We
just don't need it.  It's good to know why you like us, but it doesn't
help much to hear all about why you don't.  Like Groucho Marx says:
"Give me a rose or leave me alone."<P>

But I'm glad to say I've recovered and I'm happier now.  And just for
the hell of it, here's the very final final version of the novel, the
minimalist version I created a couple of workshops after the last one,
after I had turned it from a novel into a novella into a short story, a
very short story in fact, and not even so short that it isn't bad.  But
I do think I managed to cut out every word that isn't true, so here's
what's left.  It's called

Anyway ... I'm now mainly interested in exploring different ways to
present literature in a technological setting, or (if I'm in a different
mood) different ways to present technology in a literary setting.  I
think I've found my "niche" in life, and I'm having a good time.  I run
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/">Literary Kicks</A>,
and this where I put most of my writing.  I've also published a few
pieces at other literary sites.  Here are some of them:<P>

my favorite experimental webzine.<P>

An essay called <P>

<A HREF="">The Passion of Data</A>
</CENTER><P>
appeared in Meg Wise-Lawrence's
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/acorn/">Acorn Mush</A>
(and in fact one of the only good things about the time I wasted at
those stupid writing workshops was that I first met Meg in one of them).
 <P>

The earliest stories of mine to appear on the internet were in the
long-running fiction site
<A HREF="">InterText</A>,
where I published two stories in 1994,
<A HREF="">The Thieves</A>
and
<A HREF="">Jeannie Might Know</A>.
These pieces are pretty old by now, but I think they still read okay.<P>

Most of my other projects are listed on the main Literary Kicks page,
but what the hell, let me at least count them off here ... I put
together a
huge poetry reading featuring web writers
and other cool people this July at the
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Events/Happening.html">Bitter End</A>
in Greenwich Village, and in fact this event
was a reprise of an earlier (smaller
but also great) reading I co-arranged at
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Events/Biblios.html">Biblio's</A>
on Canal St. in Tribeca.  I also like to perform at other people's
readings
when I can.<P>

I co-edited the first anthology of internet poetry and fiction published
in book form,
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D1884777384/104-1491451-3569524">Coffeehouse: Writings From The Web</A>,
in 1997.  It didn't sell too well, but then neither did Thoreau or Van
Gogh when
they were alive (so there, hah).<P>

<I><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Notes/">Notes From
Underground</A></I>,
my CD-Rom movie, sold pretty well, helped by some nice write-ups in
WIRED
and
Entertainment Weekly
and
New York Press,
though in the end I lost a ton of money on it.  Oh well.  I'm still
eating
at Burger King (actually, I'm eating at Taco Bell).  But, you know ...
I sometimes think those burgers and tacos are better for us than
"society" wants us to believe.<P>

As for where I make my money ... I work during the day as the
Director of Product Development at an
internet content company called
<A HREF="http://www.ivillage.com/">iVillage.com</A>,
located in the Chelsea/Flatiron
neighborhood in New York City.  iVillage is a
famously crazed and tough place to work, but
most of the rumors about the place aren't even
true.  It's actually a pretty funky place to work, and
the people are (usually) nice.<P>

I love it there, actually, and I also love working in
the Flatiron district
(near the
<A HREF="">you-know-what building</A>.
You can usually spot me
eating lunch around Madison Square Park on weekdays, if you're ever
around New York City (but, by the way, don't call
iVillage asking for Levi Asher -- I'm also known by a different
name, but you'll never know what it is).<P>

Before I was at iVillage, I worked for four years at Time Warner's
<A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/">Pathfinder</A>,
which was a nice bunch of people but a pretty lame website
(interestingly, I've observed that some of the worst
websites have the coolest staffers, and vice versa -- I wonder
why this is?).<P>

I'm not particularly proud of contributing to the
<A HREF="">Pathfinder business debacle</A>,
except to say that "I
told them so" quite often, and do you think they
listened?  Fuck no.  Anyway, that wasn't even the lamest
job I ever had, by a longshot.  The worst was when
I put in two long years as a cubicle drone in the
database architecture group at
<A HREF="http://www.jpmorgan.com/">JP Morgan</A>
on Wall Street.  Brooks Brothers suit and everything.
I complain more about my job at JP Morgan in my
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/">Queensboro Ballads</A>
cycle of stories and essays, if you like to hear
me complain (hey, <I>I</I> like to hear me complain).<P>

Okay, enough talking about me.<P>

I'm 37, and I have three wonderful children, ages 4, 8 and 14.
But that's my private life, you don't wanna hear about that.<P>

Okay, I am outta here.<P>

It's a mean world out there.  Pray for me.<P>
