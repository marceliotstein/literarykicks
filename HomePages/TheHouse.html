I used to work in a robotics plant in eastern Long Island.  
It wasn't a great period of my life.  I was about
twenty-four years old and still living with my
parents, and when I went home from work I had nothing to do
except veg out in my bedroom watching
stupid game shows or getting drunk or
getting high.  Since I wasn't in a rush to get home at
night, sometimes I would try to make my life more interesting 
by taking different routes home from work.<P>

Long Island is actually pretty interesting
to navigate, because the entire island is an oblong oval (with a fish tail
at the east end) and all the main roads go either north-south or east-west,
so it's like a matrix of intersecting parallel lines that can be
traversed in any combination.  Each night I'd either start by choosing an 
east/west route first, like the Southern State or Sunrise Highway 
or Merrick Highway or Hempstead Turnpike or 
the Northern State or the 495 or Jericho Turnpike or 25A or Vanderbilt
Motor Parkway, or else I'd randomly start with a 
north/south road, like 106 or 107 or 109 
or the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway or South Oyster Bay Road or
Sagtikos/Sunken Meadow or Route 110 or Deer Park 
Avenue.  I guess this doesn't sound like the most thrilling pastime in the 
world, but it was a way to keep my life different from day to day.  
It kept me sane for a while.<P>  

As I drove around, I looked for things.  One day my aimless travels 
led me into the town of Plainview, which I remembered 
because I'd lived there for a short time in the summer of
1970.  My parents had just divorced then (I was eight years old 
at the time) and my mother hadn't 
found a new permanent home for us yet.  
She rented a furnished house from a family who went to Florida 
every summer.  It was in Plainview, and it was really weird living
in somebody else's bedroom, watching TV on someone else's set, 
eating from somebody else's kitchen.  <P>

It was a weird summer.  I remember watching men land on 
the moon on this strange TV in this unsettling house.  My 
bedroom was a girl's bedroom, and the 
girl was a Beatles freak.  The walls
were littered with photos of the fab
four.  Actually I think the Beatles
were breaking up just about this time
-- so I guess this girl was having
a pretty bad summer too, wherever
in Florida she was.<P>

Anyway, now I was an adult driving through town, and 
I wondered: where was the house we'd lived in?  
I knew the address: 8 Eldorado Blvd, but we hadn't lived
there long enough for me to remember the names of any cross
streets or main roads.  I could only remember one thing: 
I used to ride my bike two blocks north to the corner of a
large street where there were 
two stores, a Drug King and a Dairy Queen, on opposite 
diagonal corners.  I used to buy Matchbox cars at the Drug King.<P>

And my father would pick us up every weekend for his time with us, 
and a lot of times on the way back we'd all 
stop at the Dairy Queen for some ice cream 
before he dropped us off.  There was a vacant lot 
across the street from the Dairy Queen and next 
to the Drug King, and I used to wander among the 
weeds there, looking for frogs or bottlecaps.<P>

I couldn't find anything familiar, but I did find a Taco
Bell, so I decided to have a couple of 
burritos.  As I sat there eating, 
I watched the cars go by through the window, and then I 
gradually focused past the cars onto the other side of the
street, and as I peered blearily, as if through a rainy window, 
I suddenly realized that I was staring at a Dairy 
Queen.<P>

And I shot a quick glance to my right and saw 
a nondescript little drugstore called Drug King.  <P>

And I realized that the Taco Bell I was sitting must 
have been built over the vacant lot where I used to wander.<P>

Feeling dizzily in the midst of an incredible revelation, 
I tried to calculate where Eldorado Blvd would be in relation 
to these stores.  But I was confused, because I knew I'd always
come out of the development on the Drug King 
side of the street, but that side faced south, and 
that meant our house faced north, whereas I'd always 
had a subconscious sense that it had faced south.  Not that
I'd ever thought about this specifically, this was just how I had it 
settled in my mind in relation to the rest of the universe.  
I'd had it flipped in my mind, like a photograph in a mirror.<P>

After I finished eating I drove into the development and 
found, exactly two blocks down like I knew it would be, the 
corner of Eldorado Blvd.  I found # 8 and it looked 
pretty much like I remembered it.<P>

But there was no catharsis.  Nothing.  I 
sat there with my car humming, listening to the song on the radio, 
feeling like I should be crying or laughing or <I>something, but there
was nothing -- the house was there, it looked the same, and here's the
street where I rode my bike, and nothing else in the world was any 
different and I hadn't learned a damn thing except that I'd always 
had the house upside down in my head, and nothing better than that.<P></I>

I sat staring at it for about a minute and then I drove home, 
sad, angry, embarrassed and still totally lost.<P>
