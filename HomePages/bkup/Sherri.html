<h3>"This Is What You Shall Do"<P></h3>

from the preface to the 1855 edition of Walt Whitman's LEAVES OF 
GRASS<P><P>

"Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to 
everyone that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income 
and labors to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have 
patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing 
known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful 
uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, 
read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your 
life, re-examine all you have been told at church or school or in any 
book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be 
a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in 
the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes 
and in every motion and joint of your body."<P>

If you have any corrections or additions to the bibliography, I'd 
appreciate your input.<P>
