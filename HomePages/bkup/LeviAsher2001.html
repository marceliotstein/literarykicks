         I'm Levi Asher, the guy who created Literary Kicks one day back in 1994 because I was in a bad mood and felt like doing something strange.<BR><BR>Since then the site has grown a lot, and I'm lucky to have met a bunch of good people who help me keep it rolling along.<BR><BR>But I'm still in a bad mood.  I was in a different kind of bad mood before September 11.  Before then I was in more of a private bad mood.  Now it's more like the universe is in a bad mood and I'm kinda trying to help it get better, which ironically makes my own mood better, not that my mood matters a hell of a lot in the big scheme of things.  But -- did you see the movie "Fight Club" where the guy starts becoming a support-group addict?  Lately I think I'm turning into a candlelight-vigil addict.  Some of the best ones (here in NY City) are in Union Square.  <BR><BR>Anyway, I used to have a lot more to say, but lately everything else I want to say is in this novel, which you can download and read for free (it's in standard eBook format, using Adobe Acrobat).  This is my first experiment with the eBook format, and if I get a good response to the electronic version I'm going to setup a print-on-demand paperback version which I'll sell for whatever a paperback book costs.  But for now, you can read the whole thing here:<BR><BR><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/SummerOfTheMets/"><IMG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=225 ALT="The Summer of the Mets" SRC="http://www.litkicks.com/SummerOfTheMets/MetsCoverButton.jpg"></A></CENTER><BR><BR><BR>The page you're reading now is the fourth installment of the Levi Asher home page/member profile/whatever you want to call it.  It's sort of like an autobiography, although my life has changed a lot between each of these installments, and I don't think I'm finished yet.  Here are the previous installments:<BR><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/HomePages/LeviAsher2000.html">September 1999 to November 2001</A>: in which I complain about writing workshops and the whole bullshit "literary scene" and how sick I am of it all.  I was going through my divorce at the time so I may come off particularly touchy.</LI><BR><BR><LI><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/HomePages/LeviAsher95.html">July 1995 to August 1999</A>: in which I complain about the job I used to have (I work as an independent consultant now, and am slightly happier)</LI><BR><BR><LI><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/HomePages/LeviAsher94.html">August 1994 to June 1995</A>: in which I explain how I got the name "brooklyn" and a few other things.  This page goes "way back" and most of the music links are no longer active, but I left them there anyway.</LI></UL><BR>But, download my novel if you really want to get to know who I am today, even if it's a story about who I was a long time ago.<BR><BR>Here's a picture of me and my middle kid, Daniel (I also have two daughters):<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=234 SRC="http://www.litkicks.com/HomePictures/daniel-dad.jpg"></CENTER><BR><BR>And here's my with my father, and a cow we picked up up on Broadway near 72nd Street last summer:<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=269 SRC="http://www.litkicks.com/HomePictures/cow.jpg"></CENTER><BR><BR>I am still very unresponsive to <A HREF="http://mailto:brooklyn@litkicks.com">personal emails</A>.  I'd rather you post to one of the LitKicks <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/board.jsp?what=Feedback">message boards</A> if you have comments or ideas about the site.  That way I feel less personally confronted, if ya know what I mean. <BR><BR>I still try not to say 'fuck' more than once per page, though I completely break this rule in the book.<BR><BR>Love to everybody, and be nice to the cows.<BR><BR>-- Levi
