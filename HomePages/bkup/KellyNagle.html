Kelly is a real-life librarian, and holds the amazing distinction of having 
created the newsgroup alt.food.ice-cream during her first week on the 
Internet. <P>

Before discovering the internet, she was co-editor of the brilliant but
largely forgotten underground satirical newspaper <I>Head Express</I>,
which folded after two issues.<P>

Kelly would now like to share a traditional folktale that is beloved by 
librarians all over the world. It was written by her friend Claire Morga 
and it is called:<P>

<H3><I>The Little Librarian and the Magic Books</I></H3></CENTER>

Once upon a time there was a little librarian. Her name was Claire. She 
was very slim and hardly ever wore glasses. The little librarian lived in 
a little library in a little town and all the townspeople visited the 
library to borrow the wondrous books there.<P>

One day a new shipment of books arrived. The little librarian quickly 
opened the box and soon noticed that these were not ordinary books. They had 
pages of gold with silver lettering; the spines were covered with jewels; 
the illustrations were by Monet and Renoir. But, the most special thing 
-- the books were MAGIC.<P>

Well, the little librarian immediately sent a newsletter to the 
townspeople to tell them the good news and soon they gathered at the 
library to see the new books.<P>

"May we borrow them?" cried the patrons. "Well, okay, but only for seven 
days," said the little librarian. "It's very important that you return 
them on time. Remember, the due date is one week from today." So the 
patrons went home with their treasures and as the days passed, each 
thought how wonderful it would be to keep such a book and not return it to 
the library. Each began to devise a tall tale to tell the librarian.<P>

On the seventh day, the little librarian opened the library bright and 
early and anxiously waited for the magic books to be returned. But, as 
the hours passed, none of the townspeople appeared. It was getting later 
and later, but still no one came. As the closing hour drew near, the 
little librarian decided to telephone each patron and remind them to 
bring the magic books back to the library. But, with each call, she heard 
another strange story.<P>

"I was sitting by my window, reading, when suddenly a strong gust of wind 
blew the book out the window and I never saw it again."<P>

"My house burned to the ground and the book was destroyed."<P>

"My dog ate the book."<P>

"I already returned the book. It was on Tuesday. I remember distinctly, 
Tuesday at 2 o'clock."<P>

Oh, the little librarian was so unhappy. She said aloud, "I wish my magic 
books would be returned!" At that very moment, something strange started 
to happen all over town. The townspeople picked up their books but could 
not put them down. The books were stuck. "What shall we do?", they cried, 
"We must ask the librarian what to do."<P>

Well, it was almost closing time at the library and as the little 
librarian went to the front door to lock up, she could not believe her 
eyes. All the townspeople were running towards the library. They had 
books stuck all over them. What a sight!<P>

The little librarian was so happy to see all her books. And, as she 
touched each one it magically came loose. The townspeople were happy too.<P>

The little librarian gathered all the books and was putting them back on 
the shelves as the people began to leave. But a policeman was waiting for 
them to take them to jail where they would be executed at dawn and their 
souls would burn in hell forever.<P>

The End.<P>
