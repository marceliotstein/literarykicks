Three years ago I was working as a C++ programmer at the Wall 
Street headquarters of a huge and elite international bank.  My cube 
was on the sixth floor, and the marble frieze 
of the New York Stock exchange loomed outside my window.  <P>

I hated this job.  It was the kind of place where people sniffed at you 
if they didn't like your suit.  The programmers there thought they were hot 
stuff, and liked to prance around claiming they were "the best in the 
world".  What a laugh!  I'd spent the previous five years designing 
3-D vision systems for a robotics firm on Long Island.  Compared
to that work (for which I was paid much less), my new
assignments were so easy I could barely stand to do them.<P>

I'm not saying I'm a great programmer -- I'm average.  But I'm used to pushing
myself hard and producing a lot, and all my new co-workers wanted to produce
was reams of documentation about schedules and development environments and
design methodologies.  When it came time to actually make something happen,
they were clueless.  So I would ace my part of a three-month deadline in 
one month, and since I had nothing else to do for the next two months I began
surfing the Web.  I surfed the Web a lot.  Eventually I got sick of looking 
at other sites and decided to start my own, and this is how 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/index.html">Literary Kicks</A>
got created.<P>

It was a strange situation, a peculiar mix of confinement and liberation.
I used to take breaks from writing Web pages and take walks, and 
I think I walked every street and alleyway of Lower Manhattan.  
One day I hopped on a ferry during lunch hour and rode to the 
Statue of Liberty.  I walked up the echoing circular staircase to the 
statue's crown, looked out over New York Bay, walked back down the clanging 
stairs, rode the ferry back, returned to my cube at 3:15, banged out ten or 
twelve lines of C++ code, and fired up Mosaic (the original web browser, 
in the days before Netscape) at 3:30.  In a way, this was a great life.<P>

But I was miserable.  There are few things more depressing than a boring 
job, especially a boring job where people wear expensive suits and office 
politics hangs in the air like a cloud of poison gas.   I don't think 
anybody else there was much happier than I was.  It is a telling fact that 
none of us ever read 
<A HREF="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">Dilbert</A>.
We could not stand to; we were living Dilbert.<P>

I suppose I shouldn't tell you the name of this bank, now that I've 
thoroughly dissed their technical staff.  It just wouldn't be right.
But what the fuck -- I don't work there anymore.  Here's 
<A HREF="http://www.jpmorgan.com/">their home page</A>.<P>

It was my Web work that ended up saving me.  In June '95 I
was hired by a major media/entertainment company to work on
their new Web-based online service.  Now I'm working long hours,
using perl and Java instead of csh and C++, and participating 
in some truly exciting, adventurous and suspenseful projects.  I love it 
here.  Best of all, programmers aren't required to wear suits
and ties, and in the summer I can even get away 
with a t-shirt, sneakers and shorts.  Goodbye, Wall Street.  
Go write some documents ...<P>

Anyway, now that I've vented all my pent-up hostility ...
here's some of the stuff I do in my spare time.  I'm pretty heavily
into digital video, and I recently
created a 64-minute CD-Rom movie,
<I><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Notes/">Notes From Underground</A></I>,
based on Dostoevsky's novel about vanity, conformity and class warfare in
19th Century St. Petersburg, Russia (I updated it to modern-day
Manhattan, which seemed like a perfect fit to me).  I'm selling this
CD-Rom for $12.00, the first official Literary Kicks publication,
and you can purchase it either online or offline via the link
above.  I worked on this thing for two years and I really think
you won't be disappointed if you give it a try.<P>

In the summer of 1997 I co-edited the first anthology
of internet writing published in book form, 
<I><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1884777384/5534-0992294-846873">'Coffeehouse: Writings From The Web'</A></I>,
published by Manning Books.  <P>

I also do a lot of web-based writing myself, and the work I'm proudest of is
probably 
<I><A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn/">Queensboro Ballads</A></I>,
which I finished in the summer of 1995.  
I've also published poems and stories on the web in 
<A HREF="http://ftp.etext.org/Zines/InterText/intertext.html">InterText</A> 
and 
<A HREF="http://ezone.org/ez/">Enterzone</A>, two
extremely good, long-running outposts of internet-based creativity.
I also occasionally perform at live poetry/fiction readings, and
once in a while I help 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/brooklyn/Events/biblios.html">arrange one</A>
too, although I prefer it when
<A HREF="http://www.xmel.com/decemberseries.html">somebody else</A>
does the arranging (it's a lot of work!).<P>

I'm 36 years old, I'm married, and we have three kids.  Here's
me with my youngest girl -- isn't she cute?<P>

My wife is also a writer, and her web pages are
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto">here</A>.
She and I are an interesting couple, because we each belong to separate 
virtual societies dedicated to utopian cultures: I'm a 
<A HREF="http://grateful.dead.net">Deadhead</A>
and she's a 
<A HREF="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/ship.html">Trekker</A>
-- yes, there are still Deadheads and Trekkers, even though Jerry
Garcia died and "Next Generation" went off the air.  I'm also
listening to Phish a lot lately, as well most other forms of music 
from hip-hop to punk to folk.  As everybody who knows me knows,
music is a big part of my life.<P>

I also read a lot.  Here's the list of 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Topics/LeviFavorites.html">my fifteen favorite novels</A>.<P>

My email address is 
brooklyn@litkicks.com,
but I should say that I've been very swamped with email lately,
especially as I've got some tight schedules at work, my CD-Rom movie
just came out, and lately I'm barely getting time to see my
kids some days ... so I'm trying to spend a little less time pounding
away on the computer, at least for a while.   I do like getting
interesting emails, but I sometimes need to take a 
few days or weeks to write back.  I also know (all too well)
that many of my pages are out-of-date.  I will get around to all of
them occasionally.<P>

If you want to see what I was like back when I hated my job, and also 
see a picture of my oldest daughter and find out what musicians and TV 
shows and world religions I like, here's 
<A HREF="../HomePages/LeviAsher94.html">my old home page</A>.   
I keep it around because I'm just a sentimental kinda guy.<P>

If you're interested in my technical environment: I do all my Web work in 
Unix, and write my pages in raw HTML using the 'vi' text editor.  There is 
no spell-checker in 'vi', which is my ready-made excuse if you find any 
errors.  I'm proud to say that no Microsoft products assisted me in the 
building of my Web pages -- that's not to say that I didn't use them, but 
just that I don't remember them ever assisting me.<P>

Thanks for listening!  I try not to say 'fuck' more than once per page.  
See you 'round the Web ... <P>
