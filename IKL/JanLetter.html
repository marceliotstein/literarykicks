Dear Dean Marcus:<P>

I was  shocked and dismayed this past June 5th to be barred from
speaking at New York University's Kerouac Conference.  Then, being
thrown out by police added insult to injury, since, as everyone
could plainly see, I posed no threat  accompanied by a silverhaired
gentleman, Jacques Kirouac from Quebec, the founding President
of <I>L'Association des familles Kirouac.</I><P>

My intention had been to introduce him to the NYU audience.  I
also had some very important and relevant information that I wanted
to announce about an offer from two major libraries, who
were each offering a million dollars for my father Jack Kerouac's
archive: namely, the New York Public library and the Bancroft
library in Berkeley, California.  My only planned agenda was to
call in good faith on John Sampas, whom I knew was present,  to
join in an agreement with myself and my cousin Paul Blake, Jr.
 (Jack Kerouac's nephew) to ensure that Kerouac's works are put
in a library for safekeeping.<P>

But it was quite obvious that no one even wanted me to open my
mouth about this.  Not even Allen Ginsberg, who was  my close
friend for 35 years.  He was on stage, on the panel, and admonished
the police to take us away.  Needless to say, Mr. Ginsberg has
shown himself to be the worst sort of hypocrite - having stood
along with Kerouac, throughout the 50's and 60's, and even after
my father's death, for freedom of speech and expression. Now he
turns his back on his best friend's daughter and her struggle
to preserve her father's archive.<P>

As I was led out of NYU that day, I couldn't believe what was
happening. It was truly a nightmare to be ejected from a conference
about my father and not be allowed to say <I>one word</I>.
 I even had to pay to get in.<P>

Gerry Nicosia, a major biographer of Jack Kerouac, author of <I>Memory
Babe</I>, was with me. We had both been invited to the NYU conference
in 1994.  Moreover, Helen Kelly's three reasons for not inviting
us this year were wholly ludicrous:

<OL>
<LI>They <I>didn't</I> want any biographers present.  No?  Then
what are Ann Charters, John Tytell, and Jim Jones, if not biographers?</LI>
<LI>It was going to be an entirely different cast of characters
this time.  Joyce Johnson, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, Ann
Charters, Anne Waldman, Ed Sanders, David Stanford, John Sampas
- sounds the same to me!</LI>
<LI>This conference of 1995 was going to be more about Jack's
writing than about his life . But Gerry Nicosia is the one <I>critical</I>
 biographer of Jack Kerouac, and I am a professional writer and
have lectured about my father's writing many times. Furthermore,
how can people like Andy Clausen, Lee Renaldo, or Sam Charters
- who were all honored guests at the conference - be considered
experts on my father's writing?</LI>
</OL>

Ironically, ever since I filed suit against the Sampas family
for the forgery of my grandmother Gabrielle Kerouac's will, all
the so-called 'Beats' have turned their backs on me.<P>

 I wonder why would they suddenly be against Kerouac's only child
.... Could it be because they're all bought off or threatened
by John Sampas?

Well, I can imagine a poor poet succumbing to influence peddling
... but, New York University?  I hate to think that the academic
world would stoop so low.<P>

I beseech you to reexamine your principles.<P>

Sincerely,<P>
Jan Kerouac<P>
