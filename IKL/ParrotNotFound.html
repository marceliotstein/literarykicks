This page used to contain an excerpt from the late Jan Kerouac's
novel "Parrot Fever," published here for the first time anywhere
with Jan's permission about a year before she died.  Since her
death, the executors of Jan's estate have asked me to cease 
running this excerpt.  With regrets, I have agreed to do so.<P>
