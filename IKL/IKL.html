</CENTER>

"Inside the Kerouac Legacy" is an independent section within Literary
Kicks, maintained by 
<A HREF="http://www.charm.net/~brooklyn/IKL/RalphVirgo.html">Ralph Virgo</A>
 and devoted to presenting
original contributions from people who knew Jack, or otherwise have a
significant connection to him, i.e., people "on the inside."<P>

The inaugural article is by Gerald Nicosia.  Gerry is one of the
foremost Kerouac biographers, the author of <I>Memory Babe</I>,
a critically acclaimed biography (an updated version has just
recently been published).  He is also a close friend and colleague
of Jan Kerouac, Jack's daughter and herself an acclaimed novelist.  <P>

An open letter by Jan Kerouac to New York University, protesting the 
treatment she received by the organizers of a recent Kerouac conference, is 
the second entry in this series.<P>

We anticipate frequent contributions from both Gerry and/or Jan.
Additionally, Jack's brother-in-law, John Sampas, has also been
invited to contribute either directly or through his designees.
As of the beginning of this publication, he has declined.  The
invitation remains open, and will be formally extended again.
We are currently contacting others who knew Jack, and do hope
to feature contributions from a number of people.  <P> 

In terms of topics ... anything pertaining to the Kerouac legacy
is fair game. In terms of format, we hope to see critical essays,
reminiscences, discussions, and broadsides.   <P>

As many of you know, there has of late been growing controversy
around the deposition of Jack's estate, and related issues.  
Jack's estate is within the purview of his legacy, and its deposition 
is of interest to Kerouac scholars,
as well as just plain Kerouac fans.  While we don't intend
to focus exclusively on this issue, IKL will provide an uncensored
forum for its discussion, as well as discussion of any other issue 
relevant to the Kerouac legacy.  We hope to cover all viewpoints
fairly, and to avoid taking sides ourselves.<P>

The people who bring you IKL and Literary Kicks neither add nor subtract
from published articles.  Articles are presented exactly as submitted
by their authors.  Any representation of facts, claims, characterizations,
or any other statements made by the authors are the sole responsibility
of those authors.  <P>
