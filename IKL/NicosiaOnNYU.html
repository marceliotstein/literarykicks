Beat Generation Conference</H3>

I began to think there was something funny about
the NYU Beat Generation conference--officially called "Legacy
and Celebration"--from the moment I heard about it.  It was
the <I>way</I> I heard about it.  Brad Parker and his Lowell Corporation
for the Humanities had brought me to speak in Lowell during Kerouac
Week in October, 1993.  Already things in the Kerouac world had
gotten to such a point that my event was under official boycott
by the self-appointed Kerouac Committee in Lowell, which had refused
to announce my event from any of their platforms.  And when my
old friend Michael McClure, after finishing his performance with
Ray Manzarek, chose to mention to the audience that they ought
to go hear Gerry Nicosia the following afternoon, one of the members
of the Kerouac Committee nearly popped his gasket.  His face red
as a beet, he rushed at me, threatening a lawsuit, and then rushed
at Brad Parker, calling Parker a "son of a bitch!" <P>

Now when you're suddenly hipped to the existence of some invisible
wall that's meant to keep you out, your eyes and ears usually
open a little wider than before; and such was the case when I
heard Helen Kelly, Special Programs Director for NYU, discussing
an upcoming Beat Conference with Mark Hemenway of <I>Dharma Beat.</I>
 I introduced myself to Ms. Kelly, and she confirmed that they
were indeed planning a major Beat conference, and had been doing
so for many months, with Ann Charters as their main chairperson
and pilot.  (Allen Ginsberg was nominally her co-chair, but since
he was off in Europe for several months on a reading tour, he
had not taken part in the organization in any way, other than
to recommend that Robert LaVigne be included.)  I expressed surprise
that I, as author of one of the most important Kerouac biographies,
had not heard any word of this conference yet.  Ms. Kelly said
to me, rather enigmatically I thought: "Oh, we know who you
are!"  But she did not explain why I hadn't been contacted.<P>

I told her that I had taken part in all the previous Beat/Kerouac
conferences, including the one in Plymouth, England, in 1987,
and that I certainly wanted to be included in this one.  She assured
me that I would be hearing from her soon.<P>

When several weeks passed without any word from her, I called NYU.  
I was then informed by Ms. Kelly that "we're sorry but there's no room for you
at the conference."  Flabbergasted by such a response, I
almost wanted to make a bad joke of it: "Well, Helen, I haven't
gained that much weight yet--I think I'll still fit through the
door."  Instead, I tried logical protests, about how much
I could contribute based on all the Beat lore I had already gathered,
as well as the fact that I had taught Beat literature at both
the University of Illinois and UCLA.  But I got nowhere.  NYU,
it seemed, had shut the door in my face.  Or actually, not quite.
 Helen Kelly told me that if I wanted to register for the conference
(and presumably pay the $225 fee) I would be allowed to attend
as a spectator. <P>

Now for those who haven't been to many (or any)
of these events, I need to put this one in the context of what
had gone before.  The 1982 <I>On the Road</I> conference at the
Naropa Institute in Boulder welcomed anyone with reasonable credentials
who wanted to speak.  I was notified well in advance, even though
my biography <I>Memory Babe</I> was still a year from publication;
and I hitched a ride there with Edie Parker, Kerouac's first wife,
who took it upon herself to drive cross country from Michigan
in order to offer her own perspective--and when she got there,
she was gladly given a place on some of the panels.  Even Charles
Jarvis's son, who had written nothing on Kerouac but who wanted
to dispute some points in his father's biography of Jack, was
allowed on the biographers' panel, along with Joy Walsh, who had
only recently begun publishing her Kerouac fanzine <I>Moody Street
Irregulars.</I> <P>

Serious writers without the price of registration--like
my friend Richard Morris, a songwriter and poet who'd hitchhiked
up from Tennessee, or San Francisco poet Janet Cannon, currently
out-of-work--were never kept from attending sessions they wanted
to hear.  My memory of that ten-day festival was of endless good
times, poets and musicians rapping and strumming guitars together
on daytime porches or in nighttime bars, real camaraderie and
sharing, and real learning too--about ourselves as well as Jack
Kerouac.<P>

The 1987 <I>Rencontre Internationale Jack Kerouac</I>
in Quebec City had that same open-hearted, communal feeling. 
Word of it was disseminated to all the Beat communities many months
ahead of time.  It's true that one of the organizers, Eric Waddell,
was a bit nonplussed when people he did not know--such as Jack
Micheline and John Montgomery--simply announced to him out of
the blue that they were coming to perform.  Yet it only took a
word from someone who knew them (such as myself) and could vouch
that they were genuine to guarantee them welcome.<P>

As I talked to various members of the West Coast Beat community, artists and
writers, about the coming conference in New York, I found that
dozens of major people had never been notified at all.  These
included Jack Micheline, Jack Hirschman, Harold Norse, Paul Krassner,
Eileen Kaufman (Bob's widow), David Meltzer, and many important
photographers and artists, such as James Mitchell, Michelle Boleyn,
and Kristin Wetterhahn.  The latter was finally invited at my
suggestion by Bernie Mindich, the arts consultant and originator
of the whole conference, who turned out to be one of the most
open-hearted people connected with it.  Other major West Coast
Beat biographers and scholars had not been notified either--Dennis
McNally, Bruce Cook, Barry Gifford, nor had perhaps the greatest
Beat archivist of them all, San Francisco's own Cloud House founder,
Kush, who has recorded almost every major Beat event, including
the 1982 Naropa conference.<P>

When Eileen Kaufman, Harold Norse, and Micheline approached NYU 
about participating in the Beat conference,
they were all initially rebuffed as well.  Micheline was then
accepted by Mindich to show his artwork, but still told that he
could not participate as a poet.  And though he finally did get
to read some poetry there, he was never allowed on the main stage
at Town Hall, which was supposedly reserved for only "the
elders of Beat poetry."   Somehow Micheline, who's 65 years
old and has published hundreds of poems over a period of 45 years,
didn't qualify for that gig; though Ann Charters, who hasn't published
a poem (to my knowledge), did.<P>

Perhaps most surprising, Jan Kerouac--daughter
of the man who had named the Beat Generation, and a fine novelist
herself--had not so much as received a post card about the event.<P>

All this might not seem grounds for suspicion, except that a
lot of strange things were going on in the background too.  When
I had been in Lowell in October, I had discovered that about a
dozen documents had been selectively removed from the huge body
of research materials (the <I>Memory Babe</I> collection) that
I had deposited at the Mogan Center special collections library
of the University of Massachusetts (formerly the U. of Lowell).
 The only things that were taken were documents that pertained
to the fact that Jack Kerouac had been planning to divorce Stella
Kerouac before he died, and/or to the fact that he had wanted
to leave his literary estate in the hands of his sister's only
son, Paul E. Blake, Jr.  But when I tried to get the librarian
Martha Mayo to report this theft, believing there might have been
a political motivation for it, Ms. Mayo refused, saying she was
"certain" that these items had been removed by a young
thief who had stolen some rare books on the raising of silkworms
(which he quickly sold for cash) in 1990. <P>

The most potentially damaging document that was stolen from my collection 
was the xerox of a letter from Jack Kerouac to his nephew Paul, written the
day before he died, in which Kerouac said he planned to divorce
Stella Sampas and did not want "my wife's one hundred Greek
relatives" to get "a dingblasted fucking goddamn thing."
 Within a few weeks after my return to California, having put
out word that I meant to complain about the theft of these items,
I received a call from George Tobia, the lawyer representing the
Sampas family, who indeed now control Kerouac's entire literary
archive.  Mr. Tobia wanted me to declare that the October 20,
1969, letter from Kerouac to his nephew Paul was a forgery.  I
told him, on the contrary, that I had the evidence of several
other Kerouac letters--already proved to be genuine--which were
clearly typed on the same typewriter as the letter to "Little
Paul" Blake. <P>

Although there is not space here to get into
all the other strange twists that were part of this tangled background,
I must also menton the fact that Ann Charters had been chosen
by John Sampas, representative of Stella Kerouac's heirs, to edit
a number of forthcoming Kerouac books, to put together a Kerouac
CD-Rom, and to consult with him about the cataloguing of the Kerouac
papers in his possession.  After learning that John Sampas was
putting pressure on Ann to censor Kerouac's letters (to keep out
Jack's letters to Joyce Johnson and other people the Sampas family
disliked, for example), I wrote Ann a long letter stating that
scholarly integrity should keep her from being part of such an
enterprise; and also advising her that I had learned of Jack Kerouac's
archive being broken up for sale to collectors in a most unscholarly
fashion, and also that Jack's own family, Jan Kerouac and the
Blakes, seemed to be getting the short end of the stick in all
these dealings.  My letter had been written because Ann had asked
me to tell her what I knew on this subject; but after I told it
to her, she never wrote or called me again. <P>

Still, I might seem to be stretching to make a connection between all 
this and what was going on with the NYU conference.  Except that when the Kerouac
Memorial was dedicated in Lowell in 1988, Ann Charters had not
been invited by the official Kerouac Committee; but I had arranged,
through my friend Brad Parker, to get her invited as part of the
biographical forum that he had organized under the auspices of
his organization, the Lowell Corporation for the Humanities. 
I had literally been the person responsible for bringing Ann Charters
to Lowell in 1988; and now, for some reason, she had chosen not
even to tell me about the major Beat conference whose literary
program was solely in her hands.<P>

When Jan Kerouac called Helen Kelly, Ms. Kelly at first told her 
she would be glad to have her--in
fact, Jan's name and picture were prominently featured on subsequent
publicity.  But Jan, like myself, was told that NYU had no place
for her to stay; and of course she would have to pay her own airfare.<P>

As for me, I received support from Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
and other major Beat figures, who informed Ms. Kelly that I should
definitely be included in the conference.  At last, in mid December,
I got a call from Helen; she said that Ann Charters had decided
to put me on the spontaneous poetics panel.  I suggested then,
and later in letters, that I would also have significant things
to contribute on such panels as "overview/ history"
or "legacy/ connections and influences," but those suggestions
were completely ignored.  I later concluded that "spontaneous
poetics"; must have seemed the safest place to put me--where
I could have nothing to say about the current state of Kerouac's
literary legacy. <P>

When Jan Kerouac and I finally got to NYU, we
found that there was definitely an in-group and an out-group,
and there was never any doubt as to which side of the line we
were on.  While Ann Charters was continually seen chatting and
laughing with John Sampas, she did not as much as say hello to
me; she said hello, and nothing more, to Jan one time.  At the
start of the NYU Beat week, Jan had given a press conference (in
which I had taken part), announcing her discovery of evidence
that her grandmother Gabrielle Kerouac's will had been forged,
and also that Jack Kerouac's literary archive was being cut to
pieces for the sake of making the maximum profit from it.  Though
Ann Charters was the only active chairperson directing the literary
half of the conference, and though she took part in something
like six panels and presentations herself, these significant discoveries
were not so much as mentioned once during the entire week--nor
were Jan and I given a chance to bring them up--outside of one
instance, when I was directly questioned about these matters by
a member of the audience, after my panel on spontaneous poetics.<P>

Jan Kerouac and Paul Blake Jr. Another remarkable occurrence went
unnoted as well.  Thanks to my sleuthing, Paul Blake, Jr's son,
Paul E. Blake III, had been located, living with his mom near
Carson City, Nevada.  His father, Jack Kerouac's nephew "Little
Paul," had not been seen for a year and a half, and eighteen-old-Paul
E. Blake III had been living in dire poverty with his mom and
his half brother.  Six times in two years they had been homeless.
 That spring, they had found themselves living out of a truck
in the midst of a Nevada snowstorm, and I had wired them fifty
bucks for food.  Now, thanks to Jan's generosity, young Paul was
able to come to New York, to take part in the Beat week, and to
meet his cousin for the first time.  After 25 years of separation,
the two branches of the Kerouac family had finally been reunited,
but not a ripple was felt in the official conference program from
such a seemingly momentous event--though I had a little smile
to myself at having played a small role in making it happen. <P>

For both Jan and me, it was a heavy expense to pay for our own airfare
and our own hotel rooms off campus (not to mention caring for
young Paul too), but we were told, repeatedly, that there were
no rooms available for us, and no money allocated for airfare.
 For Jan, there was an additional burden--not to mention a liability
to her health.  Since her kidneys failed in 1991, she stays alive
only by doing self-dialysis four times a day.  This process involves
setting up an IV pole, heating a special fluid in a microwave
oven, and running that fluid through her body to cleanse her blood.
 It has to be performed at regular intervals, or she can become
deathly sick.  Because of the difficulty of taxi-ing back and
forth between the NYU campus and her hotel, over a mile away,
she actually missed a couple of dialyses during the course of
the conference.  Everyone who spent time with her there noticed
how haggard and worn she looked.<P>

At the very end of the conference, we both learned, to our great 
indignation, that there were six
or eight empty suites in the University Apartments complex where
all the other conference participants had been housed.  We were
told this by one of the participants, Douglas Brinkley, who also
informed us that he and the other participants--all except ourselves--had
had their airfare paid to and from New York.  It turned out there
were so many empty guest suites that even Gregory Corso's teenage
son Max was given one--and <I>his</I> airfare was paid, though
he wasn't even a participant! <P>

he night of the Poets' Banquet,
there was a special head table for all the luminaries--of course,
Ann Charters was seated there, with Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, McClure,
et al.  Jan had not even been offered a seat at the head table,
though the word "BEAT" was plastered on posters all
around the room, the word her father had made famous.  The man
who had given Kerouac the word <I>beat,</I> Herbert Huncke, was
conspicuously absent not only that night, but from the whole conference.
 I was told by a friend of his that he wanted nothing to do with
this conference, for he too didn't like the way it was being run.<P>

Though Jan sat at a table in the far corner with her cousin Paul
Blake III, myself, my mother, and a friend named Buddha, a steady
stream of visitors and admirers trooped over to pay her their
respects all evening.<P>

While I don't consider myself a luminary,
I had hoped there would be some notice of the new edition of <I>Memory
Babe</I> that had just come out from UC Press.  NYU told UC Press
that they would have to pay $300 to display the book, which was
out of the realm of possibility for an academic publisher; but
UC was promised that if they sent a poster of the book's cover,
it would be prominently displayed.  UC went to trouble and expense
to make a striking poster of <I>Memory Babe</I> several times
the size of the original cover.  Once it arrived at NYU, it was
never seen again.<P>

The horrendous treatment of Harold Norse, the
senior member of the conference, was just further evidence of
the highhandedness with which the whole event was run.  When Harold
pointed out that he was actually pictured in a photo on the cover
of their brochure, they finally agreed that he could come, but
they made clear they could offer him no money to get there.  If
he did come he would be able to participate fully, he was assured.
 The only catch is that Harold is totally without money and lives
on government assistance.  So I raised the money privately for
Harold's airfare, and a friend offered to put him up.  Then, just
as with me, Harold was told that there was no room for him on
any of the panels (although finally, through my intercession with
Anne Waldman, he was allowed to participate on the last day on
the panel that she chaired). <P>

I felt strongly, however, that Harold
should be included in the Town Hall reading.  The author of a
dozen books, Norse was a confrere of Auden and Tennessee Williams,
and was called the best young poet of his generation by William
Carlos Williams.  His poetry collection <I>Hotel Nirvana</I> (City
Lights) was nominated for a National Book Award.  But I was told
by Ms. Kelly that no possible change could be made in the Town
Hall line-up to accommodate him--allegedly "due to union
regulations"--even though he is 78 years old and has a life-threatening
heart condition.  Yet in the last few days, room was made on the
program for Andre Voznesensky, who had just arrived in New York.
For Voznesensky, a bellowing ham who gets more than his share
of the spotlight on several continents, that appearance was one
more jaded gig; for Harold it could have been the crowning achievement
of sixty years devoted to poetry and literature.  Instead, he
went home sick, like Jan, from the arduous commute between his
room and the campus.  His voice was scarcely heard on that last
day, when he went on exhausted, forced to wait an extra hour and
a half for Hunter Thompson to finish his over-time, mumbling reminiscences.<P>

The all-time low for me was the day Ned Rust, Ms. Kelly's assistant,
tried to stop me from bringing my blind 83-year-old mother into
one of the lectures.  My mother has been an honored guest at almost
every major Kerouac/Beat event since the 10 year anniversary of
Jack's death at the Spaghetti Factory in San Francisco in 1979,
and she is always dutifully greeted (and often embraced) by Allen
Ginsberg.  But Mr. Rust was on the verge of strong-arming me to
keep her out because she was not "properly registered"!
 I hooked my arm in hers and swept past him, challenging him to
call the police on us.  The next day, when he accused me of "sneaking
her in," I told him to fuck himself--which was the only time
I lost my temper during the course of the conference--a remarkable
restraint on my part, considering everything else that was going
on. <P>

I do not suppose that politics can be kept entirely out of
literary conferences; but on the other hand, one does not expect
them to be run like the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch either.  I felt
the iron hand of a fascist-like control from first to last, and
it soured my whole experience of the conference, despite the many
good people who came and the many noteworthy contributions to
scholarship that were presented there.  There was almost none
of the good fellowship, spontaneity, and kind spirit that pervaded
every other major Beat/Kerouac conference I have attended; and
without those qualities, the study of Beat becomes merely an academic
travesty, a cruel fossilization of something whose ability to
touch millions came not from power-grabbing or status consciousness
but from a celebration of the beating human heart.<P>

That beating heart never got heard at NYU, not through the armor plating that
was laid over it.  The reason for that armor plating can only
be speculated upon; but I would wager it had nothing to do with
the pursuit of truth and joy, to which Jack Kerouac, like many
of these others, had dedicated his life. <P>
