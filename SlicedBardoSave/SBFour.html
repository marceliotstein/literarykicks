<I><BLOCKQUOTE>Patricia Elliott, a friend of William S. Burroughs in Lawrence, 
Kansas, posted many heartfelt accounts of his last days and the days
that followed his death to the BEAT-L, an internet mailing list where
she is often a lively part of the conversation.  (If you'd like to 
know how to join this list, visit 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">this page</A>).<P>

I was tempted to include all of Patricia's posts here, but decided
instead that this description of a Tibetan/Egyptian-inspired death ceremony 
had special power and was best left to stand alone.  
Burroughs was a writer who thrived on contradiction, and so I 
particularly liked the idea of a 
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhist</A>
death ceremony for a man whose strong skepticism and 
libertarianism did not make him a natural
Buddhist in life.  (Example: In a letter to 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>,
who was deeply involved with Eastern philosophy for 
most of his later life, Burroughs once wrote: "A man who 
uses Buddhism or any other instrument to
remove love from his being in order to avoid,
has committed, in my mind, a sacrilege comparable
to castration.")<P>

The energy and humor of clashing ideas has always been at the
heart of Burroughs' art.  In that spirit, here's a scene from the
final act of his life story.<P>

 -- Levi Asher<P></I></BLOCKQUOTE>

All week long I didn't want to go.  I felt swept with anxiety and
decided about 7 times I wouldn't go.  James [Grauerholz], who never calls me, called
me around 1 PM and said he was just checking in to make sure I knew to
come.  Bob, John Myers, Lena and I drove out to Wayne Propst's farm for
the bardo around six.  Wayne was a close and dear friend to William and
an old and dear friend to me.  Wayne is a mad scientist, ingenious with
all things mechanical.  I made a pasta salad and John Myers  took a
six pack.<P>

Wayne and his family live on lush riverfront land, lots of
outbuildings, scene of hundreds of experiments and gatherings.  William
really never missed Wayne's  parties. Lena heard at school from a
friend, who was also going to the bardo, that Wayne might blow something
up.  The excitement builds when Wayne is involved. Wayne has an old
farm house, many outbuildings, trees, giant warm barn.  His property
runs along the Kansas River (we call it the Kaw River).  Beautiful kaw
valley bottoms. <P> 

The bardo is staged to be in front of the barn, in a small pasture. 
The big barn doors open to the pasture, flooding light from one space
into another.  In the middle of the pasture there was a massive dome-shaped
heavy wire cage with a wire doorway.   Inside were lumber,
fireworks, pictures, and pages and pages of things that people brought
and were bringing.  I guess there were a hundred and fifty people.  I knew a
hundred of them, wide varieties of different folks, overwhelming for
me.  Actually exchanged cards with some kid that does a Burrough's site.
Perfect weather, light breeze, around 60 degrees. <P>

Around dusk, standing in front of the barn, Wayne spoke (on a nice
speaker system), then introduced James Grauerholz. Now it is
getting dark.  James reads a farewell to William's soul letter from
David Ohle, first by lighter -- of course at one point you heard a little
sound from James, when it got hot, and then someone brought up a kerosene
lantern from the barn, and James then read a note from Giorno.  Then James
said a few things and explained some of the Egyptian and Tibetan
Buddhistic relationships in the ceremony, tying in the significance of
William's writings in his book "The Western Lands".  <P>

Wayne goes to the dome and lights the fire.  It was glorious, it
grew, it swirled, popped, pulsed, danced. The cage was a dome about 12
feet high and 20 feet across.  Things like pictures, posters, objects
d'art, and many many papers were laid on the lumber, but things and paper
also hung suspended from the cage. Once the fire flowered came
Williams voice, reading from "Western Lands".  It was perfect, I swear the
fire danced with his voice.  The Cheshire cat had his smile but
William's voice was the most evocative voice.  I got up and went nearer
the fire, strode around the fire, circled it three times.  Most people
sat in chairs and on benches in a large semi circle, music, flames,
love.  I stood up with James and Bill Hatke, the sparks flew wild.  In
the crowd was William's dentist, Charley Kincaid, (he had been one of
the pallbearers at the Liberty Hall service), and he is the wildest,
funniest man, with a wonderful good soul.  That guy can distract you from
a root canal with his wit.  Fred Aldridge sat in one chair, He shot with
William weekly for ten years or more.  Fred is a tall skinny redhead. 
I've known him for 30 years. I introduced William to Fred.  William was
like a father to Fred's soul.  Fred is a talented musician and artist,
driven always to some elegant perfection. There were the New York
suits standing in the barn.  They seemed to be having a remarkably good
time, the most relaxed I had ever seen the suits.  In the crowd are
such a variety of people that I am stunned but recognize that these were
all people that William had built a relationship with over the 16 years
he had made Lawrence his home.  William loved persons rather than
people, and he loved fun. It was a fun and a sober sight to see the
embers chasing to the sky and think that's William's soul flying to the
western lands.<P>

I feel when William first died, his spirit was there in the room with
his body.  It was comforting.  Then I felt his spirit whirling around the
world, I almost know he went to Tangiers for a moment.  I feel he is
gone.  We have lots to do now.<P>

Two additional notes: Sue Brossau (David Ohles' wife) mentioned that
the fire cage was one that Wayne and William had made for a bardo they'd
held for Allen Ginsberg.<P>

For a little illumination, here is, approximately,
James Grauerholz's remarks at William's Bardo Burn, 9/20/97<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
Why are we here?<P>

Each and every one of us has a different answer to that question, and we
can meditate on those reasons while we take part in this event tonight.<P>

It has something to do with our hosts, Wayne and Carol, and I know we
all thank them for making this gathering possible.<P>

It has something to do with Lawrence, our community - not the
"metropolis" of Lawrence, frankly - but the community that 
we found when we came here, however many years ago we came here ... 
the community that we built here, over the years that we have 
been here ... the community that we share, now,
while we are still here.<P>

And it has something to do with William Burroughs.  William lived here
for sixteen years, longer than he lived in any other place in his life.<P>

Every time William went out in the town, he always ran into friends; he
had friends here, everywhere he went.<P>

And every time he travelled far away, he always came home to Lawrence.<P>

Lawrence was William's home, his final home.  He lived here, he lived
well here, and he died here.<P>

And we all miss him very much.<P>

Now, I don't know how many of us are Buddhists, and I'm pretty sure
there are no more than one or two ancient Egyptians here tonight, but I'd like to
say a few words about their belief systems concerning life, and death, and
life after death.<P>

The ancient Egyptians postulated seven souls - as William's voice will
be explaining for us, in a moment ... three of those souls split, at the
moment of the death, the other four remain with the subject, to take their
chances with him in the Land of the Dead.  But first he or she must cross the
Duad, the River of Shit, all the filth and hatred and despair of all human
history -- then, on the other side, lay down the body, the Sekhu, the Remains,
and journey through the Land of the Dead, encountering souls from your own
life who have gone before - through a thousand challenges and trials, you try
to make your way to the Western Lands ...<P>

The Buddhist belief (I can't do this justice right now, but this is
basically it) is that your soul, more or less, is reborn again and again, into new
lives.  Ideally, you would not be reborn, but escape the wheel and of
death and rebirth, into nirvana; but the highest enlightened ones consciously
vow to be reborn as many times as it takes for all sentient beings to become
enlightened, they sacrifice their opening to nirvana - that is the
boddhisattva vow.<P>

The idea is that after physical death, the soul wanders through a spirit
region known as the Bardo, re-living past experiences, facing images
left over from other lives, other karma - and then, usually after about seven
weeks, is re-born - attracted to a male and female coupling, and born
again, to suffer again.<P>

We are gathered here tonight to perform a ceremony that is ancient and
universal - the burning of objects and images associated with the
departed, to symbolize the dissolution of the physical body and its intermixture
with all other elements - for example, Native Americans, it was pointed out
to me tonight, burn the dead person's belongings immediately after death ...<P>

Now if I haven't waited too late and I can still read this, I'm going to
read you some short remarks sent here by David Ohle, and by John Giorno:<P>

First, from David Ohle:<P>

<I>"Sendoff Message to the Soul of Bill<P>

Well now, Bill.  They say you've done your Bardo time, and now your SOUL
is fixing to head off somewhere.<P>

But look here, baby.  We're gonna miss that creaky old soft machine
you've been walking around in these eight score and three.  We got used to it,
you know.  Those wise and witty things it said.  And wrote.  And it must
have pumped fifteen tons of lead into the world.<P>

I don't know about souls, my dear.  But if you have one (and I know you
believed you did), then let's give it the giddyup 'n' go.  Shoo!
Everybody say it, "Shoo!  Giddyup!  Git on, Bill's soul!"<P>

And take care crossin' that River of Shit.<P>

Sorry I ain't there today, my dear, but I figure when you're talking
soul travel, what the fuck is a few thousand miles?  I'm looking toward
Kansas right now.  I see something."</I><P>

And this from John Giorno, and I'll try to approximate his delivery:<P>

<I>"You generated<P>

enough compassion<P>

to fill the world,<P>

and now,<P>

resting in<P>

great equanimity,<P>

you have accomplished<P>

great clarity<P>

and great bliss,<P>

and the vast empty<P>

expanse<P>

of Primordially pure<P>

Wisdom Mind."</I><P><P>

All right.  Why are we here?<P>

I mean, in the larger sense ... William had a very definite answer to that question:<P>

We are   Here   to    Go.<P>

Okay, let's burn it.</I><P>
