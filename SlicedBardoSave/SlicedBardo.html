It took me a while to figure out how to memorialize 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A>.<P>

There's something about Burroughs that makes words seem ridiculous, especially
trite sentimental words about death.  This is the writer, after all, 
who'd coined the phrase "Language is a virus."  When Burroughs'
fellow Beat writer Allen Ginsberg died a few months earlier, the emotional 
response 
<A HREF="../GinsbergTribute.html">flowed easily</A>, 
as Ginsberg's own literary style was warm and highly personal.  
With Burroughs it would be more tricky.<P>
 
I had gathered a few pieces that I wanted to work with. The first
was the transcript of a telephone interview conducted by
poet and Sonic Youth guitarist Lee Ranaldo, which
Lee had sent me along with three surprisingly great photos he'd 
taken when visiting Burroughs at his home in Kansas.  The second two were
short tributes I'd solicited from two writers who'd known Burroughs personally, 
Robert Creeley and Carolyn Cassady -- not because the pairing of 
these two people had any special significance in the life of
Burroughs, but mainly because I happened to know both their e-mail addresses.
Carolyn Cassady's reply was extremely curt and not very
complimentary to Burroughs, but I considered her point of view
as valid as any other, and it did not seem unfitting that there
should be some divisiveness within a memorial to
this highly controversial personality.<P>

The fourth piece is, I think, the most remarkable: a personal account
of the Tibetan/Egyptian-inspired after-death ceremony, a <I>bardo</I>, conducted
by Burroughs' closest friends and partners shortly after his death.
This was written by Patricia Elliott, who'd been Burroughs' close friend, 
and who originally posted it to the BEAT-L internet mailing list.<P>

Unsure how to make these pieces fit together, I finally decided to 
follow Burroughs' own example and give up on trying to 
reconcile the individual parts.  Burroughs had found meaning in 
the "cut-up" style of writing, in which sentences and paragraphs from
various sources are spliced together intuitively but not logically,
often revealing hidden meanings within.  Getting into the spirit, 
I took inspiration from his title 
"Naked Lunch" and Ginsberg's related title "Reality Sandwiches"
and decided to call this whole project "Sliced Bardo".   That's it, and
here it is.<P>

As James Grauerholz says in the final section, facing the fire: Let's burn it.<P>
