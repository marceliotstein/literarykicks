was another person I wrote to asking for memories of Burroughs.  I wasn't aware that 
she felt this way about him, but I appreciated her 
truthful response, refusing to be sentimental in the days after Burroughs'
death.<P>

The photo of Burrough's collection of canes and walking sticks is
by Lee Ranaldo.<P>

Trouble is, I don't feel like any "tribute"
to BB.  As I wrote, he didn't want to know me nor I him.  He represented all
that I think negative and counter-productive, if not downright destructive in
human life and the antithesis of what I believe we should all be about. I
felt somewhat better about him when the TV interviewer asked him if there was
anything in his life he regretted.  Bill's reply was "Are your kidding? 
Everything!"  I wanted to say, well, duh--I coulda told you so.  "Wise men learn
from the experience of others; fools from their own".  I know, there's this
theory that in order to appreciate the heights, you have to know the depths,
but I don't agree.  I have much to learn, but I don't think his way would be
rewarding.  So, sorry, Levi ...<P>
