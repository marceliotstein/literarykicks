<I><BLOCKQUOTE>A few days after William S. Burroughs died, I sent 
poet Robert Creeley an email asking if he had any memories of
Burroughs to share.  He sent this back the next day.<P>

The photo of Burroughs' famous orgone box, inspired by the Orgone
Energy Accumulator designed by alternative psychologist Wilhelm Reich,
is by Lee Ranaldo.<P>

Here's a brief sense of what I quickly remember
apropos Bill Burroughs.  I can't now recall just who had told me -- like
peripheral gossip -- but sometime in the early '50s I heard of someone
who'd written a 1000 plus page ms with the only objective action being a
neon sign going off/on over a store one could see (in the novel) across
the street, etc, and of someone else who had killed his wife
acidentally, attempting to shoot a glass off her head with gun he said
later characteristically undershot.  That was Kerouac and Bill Burroughs
respectively, though for a time I reversed them not yet knowing either. 
In SF in the mid-fifties, and meeting (though he said we'd met briefly
in '49) Allen, he gave me the Yage ms to read, which fsscinated me --
and you'll know I printed "from Naked Lunch, Book III" in the Black
Mountain Review No. 7 (last issue with Allen a contributing editor and
stuff from Jack, Edward Marshall's great poem "Leave the Word Alone."
Cubby Selby, Phil Whalen, Gary Snyder, Mike McClure, Joel Oppenheimer,
WC Williams, Ed Dorn, Edward Dahlberg, Zukofsky, Denise Levertov --
etc.)  I was also fellow contributor for the Big Table business -- and I
remember writing a statement in support when Naked Lunch was to be
published by Grove.  <P>

We didn't meet, however, untl some years later, must have been at least
the mid-sixties, when he was living in London and I was there for
something or other, and John and Bettina Calder had a party variously
honoring various writers, particularly Burroughs.  We were both John's
"authors" at that point and I was staying with the Calders.  Alex
Trocchi was a good friend and he too was much involved.  Anyhow I
remember making the classic gauche comment when we're introduced, saying
I was stunned with the pleasure of being able to say how much I
respected his work etc etc, and then stumbling on to ask whether or no
he was thinking to stay in London, etc etc -- to all of which he replied
briefly, dryly, yes, no -- etc.  In confusion I grabbed Ed Dorn who was
there, and pulled him over to introduce him. Instantly Burroughs
brightened, asking Ed about a recent piece of Ed's in the Paris Review
-- and how he'd managed the montage, etc.  In short, this was work and
had substance -- not just banal social blather. <P> 

Thankfully I saw him again quite frequently over the years, and got past
my school boy admiration (though never entirely).  Anyhow we'd meet most
frequently on the road and I liked his droll humor and clarity, call it,
always.  One time after a talk at Naropa wherein he had recounted his
experiences with a device he'd assembled permitting one to track by
thought "traces" or manifests of the physical entiry itself (he said
he'd found one of his cats who'd got lost), he was bemused that none of
the young had asked afterwards how to actually make the device, despite
he had emphasized that all the necessary components could be got at any
place like Radio Shack. Where's their curiousity, was the question. 
Another time, when mutual friends were sitting around him in sad
depression over fact of an impending death much affecting him, as I came
in, I am convinced he looked up and winked at me -- certainly a
communication, like they say.<P>

I've always thought of him as a literalist, as I think I was -- saying
what he felt, understood, recognized, respected, abhorred, in very
literal terms, including the fantasies.  Thinking of an early common
interest in Korzybski, the non-Aristotelian sense of "meaning" and
syntax, his use of cut-up was very practical and effective.  It broke
the classic "order" or narative as simply a "cause and
effect,""historically" ordered sequence.  I'd already connected with
Celine, for example, and Burroughs was the solid next step. <P>

I'd get occasional Xmas cards I am sure James Grauerholz helped get in
the mail -- I am grateful Bill Burroughs knew I cared, like they say. 
He was the impeccable "lone telegraph operator," as he put it. He got a
lot done for us all.<P>
