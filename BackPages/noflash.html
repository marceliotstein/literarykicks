       dear litkicks people:<BR><BR>

       well, it's that time again.  time for another crazy online experiment here on your favorite literary website.  we're calling it the <B>24 HOUR POETRY PARTY</B>, and it's going to take place completely online, starting at friday, july 23, 12 noon EST.  it will last exactly 24 hours, after which time we're going to sleep for a little while and you should too.<BR><BR>

       to make this thing work, <B>we need your help</B>.  we need to reach a lot of people.  we want this to be the biggest gathering of poetry-speaking human beings in the history of the world.  we're going for guinness here.  but we need to reach people we've never reached before.  young people, old people, tall people, short people, people who need people, people who live far away, people who we'll never ever meet anywhere anytime if we don't meet them here right now.  so what's the secret to getting these people to show up at our party?<BR><BR>

	the answer is: <B>posters</B>.  if you love litkicks, we need you to show your love right now (like right now, like today or tomorrow, really) by downloading the printable image on the right and sending at least five copies to the nearest printer you can find.  the poster is a hi-res image designed to print well on any printer -- laser, inkjet, color, black-and-white.  after you print a few copies, we need you to buy some thumbtacks or some scotch tape or some glue (whichever you prefer) and put these posters up wherever people will see them.  we're thinking bars, cafes, bookstores, libraries, anywhere with a wall.  if you can do this, we'd really appreciate it. <BR><BR>
       
     the other way you can help prepare for the 24 HOUR POETRY PARTY is by sending photographs for our party wallpaper -- see <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/News/June2004.html">this page</A> if you'd like to contribute.<BR><BR>

    we believe this will be the best party to ever take place online, bar none.  like in the history of the world.  so please mark your calendar and don't miss it.  we're going to do some writing challenges, listen to some music, talk about stuff.  we asked a few writers to contribute new work for us to present to the world during this event, and we're particularly proud to introduce a very cool set of new poems by <B>michael mcclure</B> of oakland which will definitely help to set the mood.  there are more surprises coming which we'll talk about later.
<BR><BR>

so here's the poster.  just click on the image to download a printable version.  we think the artwork came out pretty good.  supposedly the expression of the kitten contains the secret of the universe, or something like that.<BR><BR>

       please seriously do help by putting up some posters (your job/school/mom won't mind paying for the paper and toner).   thanks!!!  see you on the 23-24.<BR><BR>
