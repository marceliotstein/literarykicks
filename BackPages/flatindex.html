         Making the Cut
         </div>
         by <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/profile.jsp?who=brooklyn">Levi Asher (brooklyn)</A> on Wed Nov 10 06:12:51 PST 2004
         <BR><BR>
         Bill King (<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/profile.jsp?who=Billectric">Billectric</A>) came up with an interesting writing challenge for the people of LitKicks, inspired by the example of the late William S. Burroughs.  "Cut-ups may not be for everybody, but if nothing else, they can help overcome writer’s block," Bill writes.<BR><BR>The basic method is to pick a significant text -- a newspaper article, a favorite book, a letter privately written from a friend -- and use any variety of methods to incorporate randomly chosen phrases or sentences from the text into a new work.  You can cut up a single text, or you can stream different texts into a single output.  <BR><BR>"I pick out five very different kinds of books," Bill King tells us of his own cut-up methodology. <BR><BR>"Each choice may have some vague connection with an idea I want to convey. Sometimes I pick out books at random with no thought of connectivity at all. Even though I use words from these books, I can add my own words, delete as many words as I want, use different forms of the same word, like adding –ing, -ed, singular to plural. Anything goes!"<BR><BR>Bill goes on to describe an intricate method of selection involving a pair of dice and an <A HREF="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/gary.leeming/burroughs/cutup_machine.htm">online cut-up generator</A>.  In fact, cut-ups do not even require dice or heavy machinery.  All you need are some interesting texts and your own imagination.   We'd like to invite you to cut something up and post the results here.  If you'd like, you can tell us about your original texts and how you worked.<BR> <BR>William S. Burroughs is the writer most associated with the "cut-up" method, but in fact previous masters like James Joyce ("Ulysses") and T. S. Eliot ("The Waste-Land") incorporated splices of seemingly random texts into their best works.  Let's see what you come up with.

      <DIV class=header>Seen & Heard</DIV>
          by Caryn Thurman (firecracker) on Tue Nov 09 08:16:29 PST 2004 
          <p>While much of it may not be widely reported by the &quot;mainstream 
            press&quot;, there's always something exciting, interesting or just 
            plain strange happening in the world of literature and publishing. 
            Here are just a few recent items of note:</p>
          <p>-- Spoken word sensation and social activist Saul Williams kicked 
            off his North American tour last week and is scheduled to make at 
            least two dozen appearances in various venues throughout the US and 
            Canada. One show sure to make waves is his November 18th appearance 
            at the 930 Club in DC with hip-hop MC Talib Kweli. Williams' new album 
            is now available and tour dates and further information can be found 
            at saulwilliams.com.</p>
          <p>-- New Line Cinemas announced on Monday that Oscar-winning screenwriter 
            Ronald Harwood (&quot;The Pianist&quot;) was hired to begin the adaptation 
            of the Gabriel Garcia Marquez epic Love in the Time of Cholera. There 
            is no word on when the film is expected to be in theatres or on who 
            might be cast to play the lovelorn protagonist Florentino Ariza.</p>
          <p>-- At North Carolina Central University, administrators have decided 
            to withdraw the $7,000 annual budget for Ex Umbra, the student produced 
            annual literary journal. The journal was first published in 1965 and 
            was created to highlight the writings of students at the historically 
            black college. The current submissions and planned issue now remain 
            unpublished and this move seems to be another step in the wrong direction 
            for the promotion of school-supported literature and arts funding 
            in universities and beyond. It is unknown at this point if private 
            funding or donations will come through to keep this journal on its 
            feet.</p>
          <p>-- Beat icon Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Lou Reed, poet Li-Young Lee along 
            with other writers, slam poets and notables have come together to 
            create a unique blend of their talents in reVerse. A mix of genres, 
            styles and messages, the collection of poems, songs and poem-songs 
            includes 14 artists from Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. 
            We heartily support such collaborations that dare to blur the lines 
            of music, poetry and activism. Stay tuned for an upcoming review of 
            this compilation, available in stores on November 15th.</p>
          <p>-- And last but not least ... Billy Corgan, former front man of The 
            Smashing Pumpkins, is now a best-selling poet. His new collection 
            of poetry, Blinking With Fists, is currently at number 32 on the New 
            York Times Best Seller list (hardcover fiction). Corgan just finished 
            a 14-city book signing tour to promote the book. Meanwhile, another 
            rocker is riding high on the best-seller list. Motley Crue bad boy 
            Tommy Lee's new autobiography Tommyland took the number 16 spot on 
            the Times' Hardcover Non-fiction list. From anecdotes about his marriages 
            to Pamela Anderson and Heather Locklear to stories of porn stars, 
            sex tapes, drugs, anger management and the rock and roll scene, we 
            can only imagine that Tommyland will remain on the best-seller list 
            for weeks to come. </p>
          <p>These are the stories that caught our eye this week -- tell us what 
            you think and if your favorite author, poet or organization is making 
            literary news, we want to hear about it. <BR><BR>

      <DIV class=header2>The Book</DIV>
          After a year in production, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1418497800/qid=1100009122/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl4/002-7640291-0810453?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Action Poetry</a> has hit the bookshelves. We're 
          incredibly proud of this book, the first anthology of LitKicks writings 
          including selections from our poetry and fiction boards, winning pieces 
          from last year's writing tournament, and the full text of the instant 
          epic poem created by over a hundred LitKicks writers during July's &quot;24 
          Hour Poetry Party&quot;. 
          <p>We think this is a book unlike any other than has ever been published, 
            and we hope you'll agree that we've managed to capture some of the 
            energy and creativity that has always inhabited this site within these 
            pages.</p>
          <p>The best way to buy a copy is on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1418497800/qid=1100009122/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl4/002-7640291-0810453?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Amazon</a>. If for any reason you don't 
            like to purchase things on Amazon, you can visit <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/ActionPoetry/index.html">this page</a> to buy 
            the book directly from us, or to get info about how to get your local 
            bookstore to carry it. All current orders were shipped on November 
            8, so If you have already ordered this book you should receive it 
            in the mail by November 15.</p>
          <p>We hope this will be the beginning of a powerful new series of books. 
            Please support this endeavor by buying a copy and seeing for yourself 
            what kind of chemical reaction takes place when hundreds of online 
            writers from all over the world get captured in paper form.</p>
