<P>Surprise: we don't like staring at computer screens either.</P>

<P>SalonDesRefuses.com was formed to jumpstart the synergy between electronic publishing and alternative literature.  But that doesn't mean we are blind believers in e-book hype.  We are not going to try to convince you that a PDF document can take the place of a physical book, because we know it can't.</P>

<P>You know how breakfast cereal commercials always talk about providing nutrition "as part of a balanced breakfast"?  And then they show a little picture of a bowl of cornflakes surrounded by two strips of bacon, a fried egg, a cup of O.J., a slice of buttered toast, a folded cloth napkin, etc.?  Well, first of all, that is a hell of a breakfast, but that's besides the point.  What we are trying to say is: electronic publishing is good for you as part of a balanced writing career.  </P>

<P>In fact, it is becoming increasingly clear that e-books are the cornflakes in the above equation.  The simplicity of the e-book publication process speaks for itself.  You cannot publish a hard copy as inexpensively, nor can you distribute it as easily, nor can you update it as frequently.  Books will remain the ultimate standard for publishing.  E-books are useful for trying things out, for spreading the word, for getting your feet wet.<P>

<P>Scenario #1: Joe is a poet who has spent the last thirty-seven years mailing poems from his humble New Jersey apartment to the New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly and Paris Review.  One day he wakes up and says "I am sick of this shit".  He selects forty of his favorite pieces, scans in a photo from his photo album, and creates the volume of poetry he has always dreamed some publisher would create for him.  He posts it on his website and gives it away for free.  He does not become world famous, does not sign a six-figure contract with Alfred A. Knopf, and does not win the Nobel Prize (are you surprised?  Did you think we'd tell you that Joe got rich and famous?).  But he does have the satisfaction of knowing that he took matters into his hands and published the poems he'd spent the last 37 years creating.  And he does get a few nice comments on his work, which makes him feel good after 37 years of invisibility and silent rejection.</P>

<P>Scenario #2: Christina, a florist's assistant in Ohio, has an idea for a quirky, slightly bawdy postmodern romance novel.  She knows her idea is good, but she is thoroughly unsurprised when her query letters to ten top publishers and agents, selected from "Writers Market", result in nine "We are no accepting" letters and one no-reply.  She has a finished manuscript by this time, and she knows exactly what she wants the cover to look like, and what the blurb on the back should say, and who she wants to dedicate it to (her cat, Merlin).  She has two choices: shove the manuscript in a drawer and live a life of quiet despair, or publish it herself.  She creates an e-book, emails a few friends, and is astonished to discover that everybody completely gets it and loves it.  Within six months, she has found a major publisher, and she moves to New York City and becomes rich and famous (sometimes it actually does work out that way).</P>

<P>Scenario #3: Some kid in college is working on his senior thesis, a study of Poe, Baudelaire and T.S. Eliot.  He feels like doing something different to make his final paper look "cool".  He publishes it as an e-book.  His professor is impressed and gives him an A+.</P>

<P>Scenario #4: Ratface, a comic book archivist living on the foothills of the mountains of Montana, has been mailing out a quarterly summary of his archive to 243 kindred souls all over the world for the past six years, at a cost of $5.00 for an annual subscription, payable by either a check or a bill folded in at least two pieces of thick paper so the mailman doesn't steal it).  He is losing about sixty cents an issue.  Every time he gains a new subscriber he thinks "there goes another sixty cents".  Finally he sends a notice to his subscribers that henceforth he will only make the quarterly publication available in PDF format.  He receives 28 angry responses, including one particularly mean letter that calls him all kinds of nasty names.  The other 218 people are perfectly happy and continue to mail him $5.00 a year, and he is now earning a profit of $3.50 on every issue read.</P>

<P>We could go on and on with these scenarios, but we think you get the idea.  An E-book doesn't have to be better than a book to be useful.  In fact, producing one can make a tremendous difference in your future as a writer, if you play it right.  Give it a shot.  Now go eat your breakfast.</P>
