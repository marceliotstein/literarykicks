Turn off your mind relax and float downstream.<P>

This is where experimental, beat and alternative literature gets kicked around.  Literary Kicks has been on the web for a long, long time -- since July 23, 1994 to be exact -- and since we've already won the record for most years without a redesign, we are *finally* changing the site around.  The main improvement is to allow contributions, comments and various other interactions from members.  After six and a half year as a monologue, LitKicks is turning itself into an open mic.<P>

The core of the site remains what it always was: a set of biographical pages on a few Beat authors:<P>

For free-form discussions, term-paper questions, rational inquiry or random weirdness, try the <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=Utterances">general discussion board</A>.  There are boards for <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=Roadgoing">road stories</A> and for interesting <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=BeatEncounters">real life experiences with notable writers</A>. If you've written any fiction or poetry you'd like to get a reaction to, you can try it out <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=Contributions">here</A>.  Most importantly, we are now trying to accept article contributions from anyone with knowledge or thoughts to share: visit <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=WriteAnArticle">this page</A> to get started.<P>

LitKicks has always been mainly the personal creation of <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/HomePages/LeviAsher.html">Levi Asher</A>, but he's kind of sick of it all and just wants to go home and listen to some CD's for a while.  He's still around, but hopefully will blend more and more into the wallpaper each day.<P>

If you miss some of the stuff that used to be here, visit <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/page.jsp?what=LitKicksClassic">the Back Pages</A>.  The image at the top of this page is an alteration of a picture of Paul Verlaine, the 19th Century French poet.  The quote under it (turn off your mind ...) is from John Lennon.<P></P>
