<B>Latest News: We have shut down the LitKicks boards in order to begin the transformation of the entire site into the 24 HOUR POETRY PARTY.  We can't wait to get started and we really hope you'll be a part of this experiment.<BR><BR>
If you'd like to prepare ahead of time, we'd like to ask you to practice working with rhyme and meter.  Many of the activities we are planning for this party will involve contributing poetic fragments according to a specific request (for example, we may ask you to write lines containing exactly seven syllables that rhyme with 'rain' or 'door').  To best prepare yourself for this creative process, we'd like to ask you to find and read some excellent poetry today, and pay special attention to the rhythms and textures a good poet employs.<BR><BR>
Important note: even if you have never written a line of poetry before, we hope you will contribute to this event.  If you can talk and think, you have all the qualifications a writer needs.  If you haven't created a LitKicks membername yet, you will need one to participate -- <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/account.jsp"><FONT COLOR="#AF0000">start here</FONT></A>.<BR><BR>
Finally, if you're anywhere near New York City, please join us for a casual afterparty party and open mic at the <A HREF="http://www.bowerypoetry.com/">Bowery Poetry Club</A> this Saturday from 2 to 4 pm, where we'll group-read our newly invented 24 hour poem, play some music, have some fun and complain about lack of sleep.<BR><BR>
No matter who you are or where you are, we want you to be part of this party!  See you inside.
