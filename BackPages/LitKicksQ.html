I'm happy to announce that the first LitKicks book, a paperback anthology of fiction and poetry contributed by writers and poets all over the world, will be published in 2004.<BR><BR>
When I stamp the "LitKicks" label on something (whether it be a message board, a movie, a live show or a book), I am going to apply some tough standards to it.  I am not interested in publishing just another anthology to clutter the anthology shelf at Barnes & Noble.  If it's a LitKicks creation, I need to know that it's going to be a revolutionary book.<BR><BR>
Selecting which writers to publish is the hard part.  18,000 people have posted their words here ... how are we going to get a single paperback book outta this mess?  We've come up with an answer, and we're calling it The QUEST.  It's a workshop-slash-contest that will take place during the month of October.<BR><BR>
Just in case you were picturing LitKicks running a normal workshop or contest ... no, this is going to be a pretty unique experience.  We are applying Jack Kerouac's principles of spontaneous writing to the entire process, which means that:<UL><LI>We will require writers to only hand in NEW work.  We are going to help you get off your ass and write something fresh (which will be a welcome diversion for some of you, admit it).<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Credentials don't matter.  EVERYONE has what it takes to be a great writer, and we want everyone to join.  You don't need a college degree or previous writing experience.<BR><BR></LI></UL>
If you've got something to say ... if you can make us laugh or cry ... if you're going to teach us something we don't already know ... then you are the kind of person we want to publish in our book, and you are the kind of person who should participate in The QUEST.<BR><BR>
We're trying to do something pretty big here.  We're looking for the American Idol of literature (except we don't care if you're American or not).  We're looking to rediscover the primal power of simple, honest writing.  And we're planning to publish the greatest book of 2004.  So we want you to cut out whatever else you were doing that you thought was so important and <B><A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Quest/">COME ON IN</A></B>.  Let's see what you can do.<BR><BR>

-- Levi<BR><BR>

P.S. Yes, The QUEST costs money ($20) to join.  And it's true that, only a couple of years ago, I mocked websites that tried to develop solid business models.  Well, all I can say is that two years of severe recession in New York City have made me scrappier than I used to be.  LitKicks needs revenue or we won't be around much longer.  We got tired of asking for donations, and instead we thought we'd come up with something ambitious and risky to do.  As they say in poker, we are going all in with this one.<BR><BR>
So, if there's ever a time when you said to yourself "I'm glad LitKicks is around, I'd like to do more with those wacky folks" ... this is the time to let us know you're out there and jump on board our little show.  And if you count any brilliant unknown writers among your friends, please tell them about <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Quest">The QUEST</A> too.  See you inside ...<BR><BR>
