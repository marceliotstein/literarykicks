If you're in a position to offer any help, LitKicks needs a bit right now.<P>

For the first time since its launch in 1994, this site is facing a cash crisis, and we are forced to ask for donations.<P>

The irony is that the site is currently more popular than ever right now, and we're also benefitting from a couple of experimental revenue streams, an <A HREF="Visibility/index.html">advertising program</A> for indie publishers and a new <A HREF="http://www.cafeshops.com/litkicks">merchandise section</A>.  But neither of these can buffer the effect of the terrible economy, which is making it difficult for many internet sites to survive right now.<P>

Until the recent economic downturn, the highly unorganized LitKicks "enterprise" was able to thrive just by reluctantly participating in that amazing and now-legendary economic circle-jerk known as New York City's Silicon Alley.   Lucrative consulting gigs were easy to get, and in fact we avoided many opportunities to sell out completely during these years.  This turned out to be a good decision because we would certainly have been shut down by now if we had developed any corporate dependencies.  Only the toughest community/content websites will now be able to survive, and we intend to be one of them.<P>

We're not sure exactly what the future will hold, but we know we need to keep the site alive and growing month by month as we look for new directions.  If you are in a position to help with a donation of any size at all, we will appreciate this very much.   We are accepting donations via PayPal, a secure and widely-used credit card transaction processor.  If you are able to help, LitKicks thanks you deeply!!!<P>
