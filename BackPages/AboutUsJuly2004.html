Literary Kicks was founded in July 1994 by <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/profile.jsp?who=brooklyn">Levi Asher</A>, then a struggling writer bored by his tech job at the headquarters of the JP Morgan bank on Wall Street.  Operated surreptitiously from Asher's cubicle (as he pretended to work on PowerPoint presentations), LitKicks quickly became a popular online destination and critic's favorite, also gaining wide usage on college campuses around the world.<P> 

In 1996, LitKicks began hosting poetry readings in New York City.  In 1998 a separate division, LitKicks Publishing, was formed.  The first LitKicks publication was a digital video, <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Notes/">Notes From Underground</A>, which was widely praised in Wired Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, Village Voice, New York Press and Time Digital.  (Okay, if you really want to see our clippings, <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Clippings/">here are a few</A> ...)
        <H3>Boards, Workshops, and a 24-Hour Poetry Party...</H3>

        <P> LitKicks hosted a number of message boards from January 2001 to July 
          2004. These boards were available for various discussions on everything 
          from books to politics to members' own creative work. While no longer 
          open for posting, the archives are available <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/boardsJuly2004.html">here</a>.  Selected poems, stories and postings from these boards appear in the new anthology of LitKicks writings, <i><a href="http://www.litkicks.com/ActionPoetry/index.html">Action Poetry</a></i>.<BR><BR>
  
          This book also features selections from other exciting LitKicks events.  In October 2003, LitKicks produced The QUEST, a writing experience that was equal 
        parts workshop and American Idol. Over 100 writers from various countries 
        participated in weekly challenges, and we selected <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/Workshop/QuestWinners.html">Six 
        Writers to Watch</a>, the contest winners. 
        <br><br>
        In November and December of 2003, <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/Workshop/index.html">The Freestyle Writing 
        Workshop</a> offered a relaxed, focused place for writers to work on different 
        aspects of their craft. <br>
        <br>
        To celebrate our 10th anniversary, LitKicks hosted a <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/24pp/Party.html">24 
        HOUR POETRY PARTY</a>, the final result of which is a collaborative poem 
        by 99 writers that chronicles a single day in the life of the earth.<br>
        <br>

<H3>Who Keeps The Place Running?</H3>

In the Summer of 2003 we finally decided to get ourselves some job titles and official responsibilities.  Here's the LitKicks management team:<BR><BR>

<H3>About Our Front Page ...</H3>

LitKicks has gone through as many different looks as a 70's glam rock band since 
        its inception in 1994. Here's a trip back in time ... <UL>
          <LI>Spring 2003 to July 2004: The '<a href="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksJuly2004.html">Kiosk Poster</a>' design allowed us to promote our new projects and events, as 
            well as space for member cameos. This look featured <A HREF="BeatPages/profile.jsp?who=buddhabitch">buddhabitch</A> 
            and <A HREF="BeatPages/profile.jsp?who=mtmynd">mtmynd</A>, two long 
            time contributors to the site. 
            <P> 
          <LI>Summer 2002 to Spring 2003: The '<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksFunkyGlobe.html">Funky 
            Globe</A>' shot was pretty popular and we may bring variations of 
            it back. The photo was taken at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens.</BR><BR>
          </LI>
          <LI>Spring 2001 to Summer 2002: Our '<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksJun2002.html">Midsummer 
            Night's Dream</A>' phase. We still think this was a great front page, 
            but it was probably our most unpopular one ever.</BR><BR>
          </LI>
          <LI>Autumn 1995 to Spring 2001: </LI>
          <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksSept95.html">This page</A> 
          ran for a long time. We'd like to thank photograper Fred McDarrah for 
          being nice enough not to sue us for that great photo of Kerouac in his 
          Jesus pose.<BR><BR></LI>
          <LI>April 1997: This <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/GinsbergTribute.html">tribute</A> 
            replaced the front page for a few weeks after Allen Ginsberg died.<BR><BR>
          </LI>
          <LI>July 1994: '<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksJuly94.html">Remember 
            back in the days</A>' ...? This is how it all started.</LI>

        <h3>Tech Notes</h3>
        LitKicks runs on a Linux server with a <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</A> 
        database. The content management system was custom-built using Java and 
        JSP. Message boards use the <A HREF="http://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive</A> 
        software package, and the search engine is an implementation of <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene">Lucene</A> 
        (part of the <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org">Jakarta</A> open source 
        project).
