West coast trip kid
Seattle wept the day
you entered the Virginia
state sanitarium and
so did I

I miss you
I miss electric prism sculptures
we'd carve out of the ether

Mad yaketayakking
Spoutin poetry off
the tops of our heads
and walls
and friends
and neighbors head too

In candle lit box
gettin' higher and higher
till we could see the
New York skyline 600
miles away

But alas
atoms of the tounge split
chizzle traded for crayon
the streets lay empty

No madhouse doctors or pills
ever to return you from across the void

I could not answer blindly 
if i knew
the answer to the question:
two plus two;
and if asked 
why a road becomes a junction,
i'd gladly grab a map
and show it's function;
but if asked
why the world's love
seemed revoked,
i'd hold on to my throat
until i choked.

sentimentality

"Sentimentality is self-conscious emotion. It happens when, in the midst of an emotion, we want to watch ourselves having that emotion. In such moments, the feeling turns too sweet. It becomes self-consciously precious or sad—in other words, something other than it is, if only in degree."
(Clark Strand (Zen Buddhist Monk & Haiku Poet), "Seeds from a Birch Tree")

what I'm thinking of right now
is lamentation topped with fudge,
a ruby red cherry of
ridiculous awareness
with a dash of caustic nuts
to give texture to the context

this without notice,
outside of scrutiny,
becomes something other than
lamentation,
mournful obligation to
follow the winding tear
along the ear
sinking into chest

what was pity
turns to distant melancholy
softer, further from
the insemination sequence,
thudding faintly
like a direful drum

become,

remnants of clothing
hanging on the bathroom hook
he forgot to pack

walk through the dark (villanelle)

I will not walk in the dark with him
Through the black alleys of my desire.
He has never looked blindly through my skin

He tugs at my hand smells sweet of gin
tells me I am beautiful, is a liar
I will not walk in the dark with him.

When he says he needs me, it’s supple sin
to latch onto him, let nerves turn to live wire
He has never looked blindly through my skin

He looks at me gently, but has a lecher’s grin
teeth sparkling like robes for a choir
I will not walk in the dark with him

He has velvet hands that mask something slithering
there’s poison in those gaudy eyes sapphire
He has never looked blindly through my skin

He tries to touch me, I will not fuck him
given the chance, he’d drag me through barbwire.
I will not walk in the dark with him
He has never looked blindly through my skin.

you are crabgrass & vodka
by markk (salparadise)
apr 24 2001

you are dry as driftwood there is nothing to you
you are crabgrass & vodka on a tray in a lunch room
pointless purgatory of yer inaction & disappointment
you are vapid, inert, poised to do something
just poised, remain poised, prepared, preserved
crouch to spring, don't spring just rest at rest
hopelessly nailed to the chair
with a hopeless nail and a nailed chair
sing yakatuzza
sing yak yakatuzza
da ta ba ta
oooomlaut! oooomlaut!
you cry out yer hymn to a haiku sky
unmoving
unmoved
still here

zen flash: san antonio texas, sept. 2003

that was the name of the same thing
the thing with no name, the name
with no thing, nothing, a name of names
a name without a name, that which
names all names without naming
names, the name of the same thing
the thing of things, the thing that
has no name, the thing, everything
that was the name of the same thing,
all things, the thing that we cannot
form a name for, even if we could
form a name: that, the voice intoned
to me, was the name of the same thing

new york city in august

new york city in august 
is like a greenhouse
without the green
i find the people who say they prefer summer to winter
and spit on them
just to cool them off

--------------

chicago in august
by shamatha

chicago in august
is cooler than normal this year
not like '99
when all those people died
there was this place
up the street from me then
a dirty white monolith
public housing for seniors
nary an air-conditioner
protruding from a window
they'd all sit out front
and fan themselves
every once in awhile
an ambulance would pull up
quietly
we called it
"The Tomb"

montgomery in august
by ellipsis

it is 90+ degrees every day. 
the humidity is giving it about
500% these days.
it is
without a doubt
a terrible place to be.
it is also
without a doubt
such little inspiration
for a poem
that i can't write this 
in any sort of
poetic fashion.

kissimmee in august 
by PhilipHarris

Kissimmee
In August – 
I was almost struck by lightning
outside of Valencia
And I cowered against the pavement
And my heart slid out of my ear
And my veins exploded with the rumbling asphalt
And my body shook a circadian rhythm of vomiting 
And I almost died
with my car four body lengths away.

I couldn’t drive home
Because my limbs refused to function
So I cuddled my catatonic legs in a Wal-Mart parking lot.

denver in august 
by Mayo

It's been 90+ degrees since June
I'm hoping for a monsoon
The rain hasnt been much 
our hills are turning brown and such 
It was supposed to rain last night 
but this morning there was no dew in sight
If this keeps up 
I'll throw my hands up 
I'll move to the ocean of blue 
and say Denver, Fuck you!

i've been feeling that 
raw edged moment
yesterday was one of those days 
that you'd like to forget
shined the bathroom floor 
down upon my knees
deep dark silence walked 
through the front door
with a look of dante 
inferno steamed
felt like the vent of killawaya
tried to take the videos back
to the rental store
turned around halfway there
somethin' called me home
found you in a fumming rage
throwing fits and moveable objects
dogs cowering by the door
child seeking safe havens
me i got in the way
now is better than then
saying sorry is not your style
you don't know what sorry means
me i'm sorry most of the time
but at least i can dance

I came to a fork in the road
by Billectric
Jan 8 2004

I came to a fork in the road and had to decide which path to take.

I sat down to think about it and uncorked my wine. Lighting a cigarette, 
I looked around and noticed it was getting dark. I took a big swig of wine. 

I sat there for a few minutes until I heard someone else approaching. 
Stubbing out my cigarette and taking another gulp of wine, I jumped up and 
hid behind some shrubs.

Pretty soon, along came that damn Robert Frost, muttering to himself. 
He stopped for a moment where the road branched out into two roads.

Dumb fucker took the more obscure, creepy path.

Talkin' to Noah 
by Lightning Rod

Cut me open with a rusty knife
Drink a bucket of my blood
But don't tell me about my life
You're talkin' to Noah 'bout the Flood 

Talkin' to the birds about the sky
Talkin' to the turtles 'bout the mud
Talkin' to Mom about apple pie
Talkin' to Noah 'bout the Flood.

Ya eyes are pretty but your brain is dead;
Ya don't even know what I just said
Black leather jacket and a silver stud
Talking to Noah 'bout the Flood.

Wreck my woman and seduce my car
Smoke my whiskey; drink my bud
Don't tell me how bad you are
You're talkin' to Noah 'bout the Flood.

Roadrunner said to that ole Coyote
"Beep beep, sucker" and that's a quote
Bugs Bunny said to Elmer Fudd
You're talkin' to Noah 'bout the Flood

Talkin' to Casey 'bout the bat
Talking' to Lightnin' 'bout the bud
Talkin' to Felix 'bout the cat
Talkin' to Noah 'bout the flood.
