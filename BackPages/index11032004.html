        <div class="header">Shell-Shocked and Awed</div>
<BR>
      After watching too much television news last night, I got up early this 
      morning to check the latest election results, hopeful that there would be 
      some definitive answer as to who came out victorious.
      <p>The answer isn't definitive yet, but all signs seem to point toward victory 
        for incumbent President Bush.</p>
      <p>Last night, as I volunteered with MoveOn PAC for a last-ditch, election-night 
        get out the vote effort, I felt something verging on euphoria. Things 
        were looking good. The voters we were talking to were voting. And I knew 
        that in battleground states like mine, there were hundreds of people out 
        doing the same thing and, I hoped, getting the same results.</p>
      <p>It's been inspiring to stand behind someone I believed in (it's no secret 
        -- I voted Kerry) and do what I could to help. And no matter how the final 
        counts turn out, I'll continue being glad that I volunteered. But, speaking 
        from my own experience, all of that optimism and hope poured into that 
        one direction made me feel that the optimism and hope was enough to make 
        things go the way I wanted them to.</p>
      <p>Of course, that's naive. And I know that. But I also want to point out 
        if things end up going the way they look like they will, and it's a loss 
        for the guy I'm rooting for, it doesn't have to be a loss forever. So 
        many people worked so hard together because they saw a need to do so. 
        No matter who gets sworn in in January, the need isn't going to go away, 
        and I hope that sense of camaraderie I've felt sticks around. As I'm constantly 
        reminded, I'm very young, but I do still believe that community can change 
        things.</p>
      <p>And that's the end of my mostly-partisan thoughts this morning. Share 
        yours.<br>

<DIV CLASS="header2">We're Back</DIV>
      We had a nice summer vacation, and <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/earthlist.jsp">OCTOBER 
        EARTH</A> was a fascinating experiment. LitKicks is now back in regular 
        operation, and we're glad to see you again.<BR>
        <BR>
        The book is out! Selected from writings posted to LitKicks over three 
        and a half years, it represents over a hundred writers in a fast-moving 
        collage of modern literary styles and themes. We really think is the freshest 
        new anthology you'll find anywhere. <BR>
        <BR>
        The title is <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/ActionPoetry/index.html">Action 
        Poetry</A> and you can order it or find more information (including how 
        to get your local bookstore to carry it) <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/ActionPoetry/index.html">here</A>. 
        As for LitKicks itself, well, the look is different but the concept is 
        pretty much the same. Thanks for your patience, and we promise not to 
        fake our own death again for at least another couple of years.<BR>
      <br />
       <div class="header2">Start Something</div>
      If you have something to say about literature or have an idea for an 
        interesting LitKicks conversation, <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/BeatPages/createThread.jsp">post 
        it here</A>. Thanks.</p>
