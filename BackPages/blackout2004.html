          NOTE to the people of LitKicks:<BR><BR>
          The 24 HOUR POETRY PARTY is over and the first anthology of LitKicks writings is heading off to the printer. This seems like a good time for all of us to take a vacation and think some deep thoughts about how we can make LitKicks a better place in the future. <BR><BR>
          After ten years of operation, we are thrilled by the amazing power of the community that has evolved here.  But we're not satisfied -- not yet -- with what we've all done together.  As the most popular and well-known literary site on the internet, we are nowhere near reaching our natural potential to do amazing and miraculous things.  But this requires time for transformation, and this is why we've decided to "black out" the site for a short period of time.  We're not exactly sure how long this will last, but a good guess is that we'll emerge from from the cocoon in early September so we can begin a publicity campaign for the book.<BR><BR>
  Once we're back, our plan is to put the "Lit" back into "LitKicks".  We loved the experience of the 24 HOUR POETRY PARTY, and we love the interaction of our writing boards and our Freestyle workshops.  These are the kinds of things we want to spend more time on.  We're also woefully aware that we have not yet found the correct recipe to make our Articles section work smoothly, and we plan to rethink our entire approach to literary discussion and analysis as well.<BR><BR>
  As good as literature is, as good as poetry is ... that's how good we want LitKicks to be.  But most of all LitKicks has always been about people, and the most important thing is that you'll all check back with us as the summer draws to a close, so you can join in on whatever crazy stuff we find ourselves doing next.<BR><BR>
    We will be updating this page occasionally during the next few weeks with further messages.  Our boards and articles sections are closed for further postings, but you can still read everything by starting <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicksJuly2004.html">here</A>.<BR><BR>
    Please pre-order a copy of <A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/ActionPoetry/index.html">Action Poetry</A>.  We can't begin officially selling the book until we have an ISBN number and an official price (approx. $16), but we can offer a $25 package including the book and a LitKicks frisbee.  We know a bit about frisbees, and this is a good frisbee.<BR><BR>
    Love to everybody, happy summer, and let's not forget PEACE.<BR><BR>
