       dear world:<BR><BR>

       hi.  how are you?  i hope you're feeling better.<BR><BR>
       
        i want to invite you to the litkicks 10th birthday party, which is going to happen right here on friday, july 23 at 12 noon.  it will last exactly 24 hours, after which time i'm going to sleep for a little while and you should too.<BR><BR>

      it's pretty amazing to think how the world has changed since that quiet saturday on july 23, 1994 when i tapped out 'chmod 755 index.html' and litkicks was born.  douglas coupland was the hip writer of the moment back then (where are you, douglas coupland?).  kurt cobain had just killed himself, but i was trying not to feel sad that summer.  my favorite radio song was "flava in your ear" by craig mack, and that kinda captured the mood of the summer to me.   looking back, i guess that's all litkicks ever wanted to be -- some new flavor in your ear.<BR><BR>

     anyway, i think you'll like the 24 HOUR POETRY PARTY.  the entire thing will take place online.  if you want to know more, you're just going to have to wait and see.  w've asked a few writers to contribute new work to help set the mood, and we're particularly proud to introduce a very cool set of new poems by michael mcclure of oakland.  there are more surprises coming which we'll talk about later.
<BR><BR>
world, i really hope you'll like this event.  i want to do something to help with the problems you've been having, and i want you to know we are really there for you.  firecracker and jamelah say hello.  maybe this party will help cheer you up.  a little poetry never hurts, you know?<BR><BR>

hey, do you know anybody who can help us hang up posters?  we want to tell as many people as we can about this party.  we want to get old people, young people, short people, tall people, people who need people, people in different countries, people who we'll never get a chance to meet anywhere except for here.  if you know anybody who could help us put up these posters, we'd really appreciate it.<BR><BR>

here's the poster -- just click on the image to download a printable version.  we think it's a pretty cool poster.  supposedly the expression of the kitten contains the secret of the universe, or something like that.  hah, what am i talking to you about the universe for?<BR><BR>

       see you on the 23, world.  i really think you'll have a good time.<BR><BR>
