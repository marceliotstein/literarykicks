At the beginning of this album I told you to take a walk
across the Brooklyn Bridge.  Now I want you to stand under  
the Bridge on the Manhattan side, at the spot where
cars park beneath the F.D.R. Drive.  There are mounds of broken-down 
cement blocks around you, and mud-crusted blankets that 
keep the homeless warm when they come at night to sleep.  Discarded 
cans of food gather insects.  Look at the twisted 
rusty shopping carts, the thin slimy discarded t-shirts.  Watch the
dirty seagulls cruising carelessly overhead.  Step right up to
the edge of the island and feel the cool musty waves (pony waves, Delmore 
Schwartz would have called them) of the East River dabbing
at your feet.  <P>

Feel the water, and let it sink into you.  Water is life, and to
survive in the city you sometimes must go to the water and watch 
it march past, each wave like a tiny invisible soldier.  A river
is a parade of molecules, rising and falling in waves, each wave 
lapping and laughing and dancing, rocking to catch glimpses of the 
light.  <P>

In New York City, there are always 
people standing by the water, staring at it.  This is what 
Herman Melville wrote about in the first pages of <I>Moby Dick</I>,
a book I finally read after putting it off for a
long time. <P>

<I>Moby Dick</I> is not often thought of a book about New York City, 
because it so vividly describes life on a whaling ship and in the 
harbor towns of Massachusetts.   But Herman Melville was born in New 
York City, and the first chapter of <I>Moby Dick</I> presents  
Ishmael (the character Herman Melville based on himself)
standing at the Battery, the southern tip of Manhattan Island, and
pondering what to do with his life.  He is a young writer in search of 
truth and experience, but he has seen enough of New York City and knows 
there is no reason for him to stay any longer.  Where will he go?  He 
stands at the edge of the island, and notices how many other people
are standing nearby doing the same thing he is.  He describes this 
scene:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from
Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall 
northward.  What do you see?  -- Posted like silent sentinels all
around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men
fixed in ocean reveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some
seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships 
from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get
a still better seaward peep.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

All along the shoreline of Manhattan Island's southern tip, people
are staring at the water.  This vision inspires Ishmael to go to the 
sea, and perhaps Herman Melville himself was inspired by a vision like 
this when as a young man he went to sea on the whaling voyage that 
eventually gave him the raw material for his greatest book.<P>

I never went to sea myself (maybe I should have), but the first
time I read these words I was surprised, because I often spend       
my lunch hours doing the exact thing Ishmael describes.  
Battery Park is only a few blocks south of Wall Street, and while 
my co-workers usually go to the cafeteria for roast beef sandwiches 
and soda, I like to slip off for long lunches, buy a knish 
or a burrito or a hot dog or a slice of pizza, take it
with me to the tip of the island, and sit there eating and staring 
at the water. <P>

Sometimes I sit there with a stunned look on my face, as motionless as
a male mannequin, contemplating the vast horrific frustrations of life on 
Wall Street.  Other times (like on Fridays, especially before holidays) 
I am strangely calm, temporarilily peaceful like Buddha.  The wind on my 
face, the sounds of the gulls, the eternal waves rippling under 
my feet ...<P>

Herman Melville and I stand there, fixed in our ocean reveries.<P>

There are others around us.  Men and women, old 
and young, rich and poor, happy and sad, the brilliant and the insane.  
Bartleby the Scrivener might have even walked here once (like me, I imagine,
he took long lunches).  We each stand alone, lost in our thoughts, 
staring at the waters of the New York Bay.<P>

Across the way is Brooklyn, and I think of my ancestors who came to Brooklyn
from Eastern Europe over a hundred years ago.  Why did they come to Brooklyn,
a place they'd never heard of?  Because Brooklyn welcomed them, and no other 
place did.  They sprouted where they landed, like dandelion seeds.  Their
lives do not seem glamorous to me, but they did things I envied.  My 
father used to watch the Brooklyn Dodgers play at Ebbets Field, for instance.
And my grandfather, a son of immigrants, told me that as a young man he used
to go to the vaudeville theatres of Manhattan with his friends, and that
they'd seen the Marx Brothers on stage more times than he could remember.
It was the jazz age, and my ancestors hardly belonged in Manhattan at all,
with their accents, smelling of chicken soup, hands grimy from factory
grease.<P>

And yet they did belong.  Today the immigrants are in Queens; they
crowd around the Globe in Flushing Meadows Park and play happily with their 
children.  America belonged to my grandfather, and now it belongs to the 
immigrants of Queens.  The Colombians and Dominicans from Corona and Jackson
Heights, the Koreans and Chinese and Afghanis from Flushing, the Indians
and Pakistanis of Forest Hills and Elmhurst and Jackson Heights ... they
come to New York to be part of America, and America is grateful to them for 
coming.<P>

But life in New York is not easy.  We have hard times, and when things
get really bad, worse then they've ever been before, we come to the tip
of Manhattan Island, and we stare at the water.<P>

These are my loomings.  I think I'm rambling here -- but hey, if 
you've gotten all the way to the end of this album you must like my stuff.
I'm going to go now, but thanks for reading this! Send me

if you want.  I have two pieces of advice, in case you want 
them: always believe in God 
(whatever the fuck that means); and, if you have a job, don't let your job 
kill your free spirit, the way it does to so many people I know.<P>

There are more things, many more things, that I want to say about New 
York City.  But it's late at night and I'm tired.  I started this thing in 
February; now it's May and I can't remember a thing that happened in between.<P>

So, I think it's time for me to say goodnight. Peace and Love y'all!  This 
record is over.<P>
