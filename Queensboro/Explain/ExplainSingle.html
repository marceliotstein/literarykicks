<H1>My First Single: Explanation</H1>

I've been working on a new Web project, Queensboro Ballads,
which is a set of short stories and essays in the form
of an early 60's record album.  It's sort of a love letter to the
most unloved borough in New York City (well, okay, Staten Island
is a tie), and it's also about crummy jobs, lonely people, subway
trains, california burritos, good music and lotsa other things too.<P>

Like I said, it's in the form of a record album, and you can see the
cover and "song list"
<A HREF="../Explain/Preview.html">here</A>.<P>

It's not ready yet, but I decided to take the album metaphor
even further and release a "single."  The A Side is 
a photo essay set to music, and the B Side is a short story about a guy
I knew in college.  The rest of Queensboro Ballads will be available soon.<P>

Please 
<A HREF="mailto:brooklyn@litkicks.com">let me know</A>
if you have any comments!  <P>

Thanks to 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/">Levity</A> for hosting
Queensboro Ballads. <P>

Also, for those of you who don't know, Queensboro Ballads is my second
web site --  the first is
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/">Literary Kicks</A>,
a sort of free-flowing tribute to the Beat writers of the 50's and 60's  
(Kerouac, Ginsberg, etc.). <P>
