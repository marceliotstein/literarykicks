<H2>Forest Hills</H2>

</CENTER><P>

Forest Hills is where I live.  It's a quiet residential 
neighborhood with one street (Austin Street) that's kinda 
hopping late at night, though it's hardly Greenwich Village.<P>

Queens Boulevard bisects the town neatly; south of the Boulevard is an
elegant mock-Tudor village, built around the turn of the century,
with castles and turrets and village greens.  It's very impressive
to look at, and also way out of my price range.  Helen Keller was
one of the original residents of this community; Geraldine Ferraro also
raised her family here (and may still live here -- I'm not sure).  <P>

The Tudor Village is known as Forest Hills Gardens, and not all the famous
Forest Hills residents are from there.  Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel
lived near, but not in, the Gardens (if the information I have is 
correct).  And the Ramones -- the coolest four guys ever to walk the 
streets of Queens -- all grew up near where I live, in
the apartment buildings north of Queens Boulevard.  Yellowstone Boulevard 
is the main thoroughfare here, and it's all residential, just one
apartment complex after another.<P>

Forest Hills used to be the site of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, 
until the tournament moved to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
Both the old (Forest Hills) and the new (Flushing Meadows) tennis
courts are open for business through the year, which means you can 
show up with a racket (if you can get an appointment) and play on the 
famous courts where so much history took place.  The old tennis stadium
has also been used for concerts, and Bob Dylan played his second-ever
electric show there, after his first at the Newport Folk Festival.
According to reports, he didn't even get booed in Forest Hills.<P>

Forest Hills is ethnically mixed but largely Jewish 
(Joey Ramone's real name is Jeffrey Hyman), Catholic and Asian.  Many 
Russian-Jewish immigrants have recently moved into the northernmost part 
of Forest Hills, turning 108 Street south of the Expressway into a raucous 
Eastern European shopping bazaar.   Come on a Friday afternoon, and you'll get 
jostled and bumped until you think you're on line for toilet paper in the 
center of Moscow.  Saturday is the <I>shabbot</I> (the sabbath) and 
all is quiet.<P>

<H2>Rego Park</H2>

The town next door to Forest Hills is Rego Park -- the name means
"Real Good Park" and was coined by a realtor.  Rego Park was the home of
Vladek Spiegelman, the exasperating hero of Art Spiegelman's great 
comic book novel, <I>Maus</I>.  Much of the conversation depicted in 
<I>Maus</I> takes place in the Rego Park house, and a small map
of the town is on the back cover of the book.<P> 

<H2>Corona</H2>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="corona.jpg" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT="238" ALT="[Image]">
</CENTER><P>

Corona used to be largely Italian (Martin Scorsese was
born here) and now houses several Hispanic communities.   
Dominicans and Colombians predominate, along with Puerto Ricans.
The town is located on the West side of Flushing Meadows
Park, across the way from Flushing, and the photo on
the previous page of me and my son walking back home 
from Shea Stadium was taken on a side street in Corona.<P>

There's a lot of fun street life in Corona, especially 
on summer days.  I remember once going to a street fair here
and persuading my daughter to purchase an orange shaved-ice 
by saying "naranja" to the Hispanic guy working the cart.  Kids 
all around her were ordering that way -- but the guy 
couldn't understand what on earth Eliza was trying to say, 
until she gave up and said "orange!"<P>

Corona is just north of Forest Hills.  Paul Simon wrote "Me and
Julio Down By The Schoolyard" about this town:<P>

<CENTER><I>
Well Mama Pajama rolled out of bed<BR>
and she ran to the police station<BR> 
When Papa found out he began to shout<BR> 
And he started the investigation<BR> 
Now I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going<BR>
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time but I don't know where<BR>
Goodbye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona<BR>
Singing me and Julio down by the schoolyard<P>
</CENTER></I><P>

The best frozen ices I've ever had are at the 
Lemon Ice King of Corona on 108 Street.  They're made with
fresh fruit.  I always stop there with the kids when we walk 
to Mets games ... mmm ....<P>

<H2>Elmhurst</H2>

Elmhurst is the home of Queens Center, a rather wan
shopping mall located at the intersection of the Horace Harding 
Expressway and Queens Boulevard.   There isn't really much of a
community feeling in Elmhurst, and I can't lie to you and
say this is a great shopping mall either.  But it's probably 
the closest thing Queens has to a common meeting point -- it's
accessible to everyone, and is situated right in the middle of
the borough, so everybody comes by Queens Center once in a while.<P>

Did you ever see the Eddie Murphy movie <I>Coming To America</I>,
in which Eddie and Arsenio Hall come to my favorite borough looking,
literally, for women eligible to become queens?  A McDonald's 
imitation called McDowell's was one of the focal points of that
movie, and the scenes at McDowell's were actually filmed at
the Wendy's pictured here.

For those of you who don't like Wendy's, there's also a White 
Castle nearby, and there's a Taco Bell Express in the food court 
at Queens Center. However they don't have green sauce there, so I 
buy my Taco Bell burritos in Flushing.<P>

<H2>Jackson Heights</H2>

Jackson Heights is the Indian/Asian part of town, and
has a large Hispanic population (a spillover from Corona)
as well.  Maggie and I come to the corner of 37th and 74th for 
Indian food a lot, and then we like to take a walk looking at 
the sari shops and spice stores.  There are a lot
of Indian doctors in New York, and Maggie once 
cracked up when she saw that all the five-and-ten
stores sell stethoscopes in Jackson Heights.<P>

Around here you can rent "Pulp Fiction" in Hindi, Punjabi
or Urdu.  Or you can just do what Maggie and I do 
in Jackson Heights ... eat, then eat some more.<P>

<H2>East Elmhurst</H2>

Many people who live in Queens have no idea that there is a 
town called East Elmhurst, which is actually closer to Jackson
Heights than to Elmhurst.  I only found out it existed when I 
saw Spike Lee's film <I>Malcolm X</I> and then went searching 
for the house he lived in near the end of his life (the house
that was burned down by Malcolm's enemies).  I finally found
the address in this quiet residential community near
LaGuardia Airport.  Malcolm obviously brought his family here 
to be left alone, and it's sad that he did not succeed.<P>

<H2>LaGuardia Airport</H2>

It's also sad that a popular beach, North Beach, was completely
eradicated to make room for this airport, named after New York's
colorful and popular mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.  Here's what
North Beach looked like back in the days:<P>

LaGuardia Airport is smaller than Kennedy, and is used more often 
for shuttles and domestic flights.  Here's a plane landing over 
Flushing Bay -- I took this picture while getting gas at the Sunoco 
station on Grand Central Parkway.<P>

<H2>Riker's Island</H2>

Most people only get a good view of Riker's when taking off or
landing from LaGuardia.  This is where the bad boys go when 
they get caught.<P>
