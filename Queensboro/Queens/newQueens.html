<H1>Coming Back To Queens</H1>

<I>There never was a city kid truer and bluer<BR>

When Maggie and I got married and she got pregnant 
we needed to find a place to live,
and we came very close to moving into one 
of the suburban communities professional
young couples were "supposed" to live in.  We 
looked at places in Long Island and New Jersey 
and Westchester.  Then one day we mentioned to    
Maggie's parents that we'd been toying with
the idea of living in New York City.<P>

They were aghast.  Maggie's parents are rather conservative 
people, and they are very concerned with elegance and propriety.  
They do not have much money, but they see this as a temporary 
aberration and always try to do things the socially 
"correct" way.  Raising kids in the city, to them, is okay
if you live on the Upper East Side and can afford private
school, but this is not what Maggie and I were planning on
doing.  This was a bit of a setback in my relationship
with them, as they'd only recently begun adjusting to the 
fact that Maggie had actually married me.  They'd finally 
stopped telling me how much they admired the Jewish people every 
goddam time they saw me, and they'd even gotten over their shock that I
actually  <I>do</I> eat pork (which they still have trouble 
understanding).  But now we were talking about <I>living</I> in that 
cesspool of sin and racial variety known as New 
York City, and I was back on their shitlist.<P>

Once Maggie and I saw how shocked they were, we knew what we had to do.  
Anything that annoyed them that much had to be great.  Our decision
was made.<P>

We decided to be <I>extra</I> perverse about it and live in 
Queens.  I wanted to do this because Queens is one of the 
most unfashionable places in the world to 
live.  It's one of New York's five boroughs, but it's 
not sparkling and famous like 
Manhattan, and it's also not gritty and cool like Brooklyn 
or the Bronx.  It's just a 
sprawling plain of residential ethnic neighborhoods 
that hangs off the end of 
Brooklyn the same way that Staten Island, New York's 
other unfashionable borough,
perches off the coast of New Jersey.  Queens is the 
place TV comedy writers (based in 
Los Angeles) use when they want a character 
to be from somewhere funny.   
<I>All In The Family</I> took place in Queens, 
and characters from <I>Seinfeld</I> and 
<I>The Nanny</I> are from here too. <P>

I guess I was always fascinated by Queens because 
I was born there.   My ancestors had 
been living in Brooklyn since arriving from Europe 
a hundred years before, and my older
brother and sister had been born in Brooklyn.  But
my parents, like so many of their generation, wanted
to leave Brooklyn and live in the beautiful new
suburbs that were springing up outside the city, and they 
moved first to Queens (which is halfway to suburbia, at 
least when you're from Brooklyn) and then finally out to 
the swimming pool suburban heaven known as Long Island.<P>

But I was born during those Queens years.  We lived in 
Flushing till I was two, then in Rosedale-Laurelton (near
Jamaica) till I was four.  I was the only member of my
extended family born in Queens, and because of this
Queens has always had a sort of romantic 
mysterious childhood sense to me.  Or maybe I 
developed this fascination as a defensive mechanism: 
I have the indignity of a birth certificate that lists 
Flushing as my place of birth, and I suppose I needed to
develop some kind of fierce loyalty just to counter the 
utter embarrasment of this.   Flushing is
actually a 17th Century town founded by Dutch 
settlers from the town of Vlassingen, Holland, 
but it's been a target for jokes since then.  I 
remember a typical exchange from 
<I>All In The Family</I> when Archie Bunker is 
going through some boxes in his attic and 
picks up a big felt 'F'.  <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mike : What's that, your high school letter?<BR>
Archie : Yeah.<BR>
Mike : What's it stand for?<BR>
Archie : Flushing.<BR>
Mike : Oh, so that's what ya majored in!<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Real funny.  Ha ha.  Me and Archie Bunker, we're not amused.<P>

It was great fun, though, watching Maggie's parents react as Maggie and
I bought a co-op (in Forest Hills), moved in, painted it and prepared to 
raise our new daughter there.   We made them come visit us to see the baby, 
and if you want to picture the 
expressions on Lucille and Raymond's faces as 
they walked through the streets of 
Queens towards the door of our building, 
just try to picture Queen Elizabeth
and her entourage seated in the hooligan 
section during a British football match.
It was great.  From that day on they tried to avoid 
having to come visit us in the city, and begged us to
drive out to New Jersey instead, and when 
we refused they'd put on a big show
of getting lost on the city streets.  We'd
just sit back and enjoy it: every time they'd
come there'd be another woeful tale of getting 
lost in the wilds of Jamaica or almost
getting mugged in Hollis, of near-death collisions
involving maniacal cab drivers near Hunters Point -- 
neighborhoods, all of them, that they did not 
need to drive through at all to reach 
us in Forest Hills.<P>

For chrissakes, the streets are numbered here.  
It doesn't take a friggin' genius.  <P>

Maggie's younger brother Nick wasn't much of a help 
either.  He's a cool guy, but he
got married the same time we did, and right 
after we bought the co-op in Forest Hills
he did the opposite and bought a ranch on two 
acres up in the Hudson Valley.  Thanks
a lot, Nick.  I know he did it on purpose.
Maggie would be on the phone talking to her
mother, and I'd only hear one side of the 
conversation, but I'd know the other 
side:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yes, it <I>is</I> a very nice house.<BR>
No, we don't want to.<BR>
Yes, I'm sure the air <I>is</I> very fresh up there. <BR>
No, that never happens.<BR>
No, actually most of them are very nice.<BR>
Actually the water is very clean.<BR>
Yes, their living room <I>is</I> very beautiful.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Once Nick visited us on a Saturday, though, 
and saw that we get the pre-printed 
sections of the Sunday Times delivered 
to our door on Saturday.  This really 
blew his mind, that we could read the 
Arts & Leisure section and the Book 
Review on Saturday, that we had a one-day 
jump on the ads in the Real Estate 
section, that we could actually <I>finish</I> 
the crossword puzzle (if we could 
finish it) before most of the world even got 
to see it.   I saw the envious look on his 
face.  To Nick this is the one and only 
reason anybody should want to live
in New York City.  Perhaps someday he will 
actually move here because of this.<P>

Anyway, this is what Queens looks like. Click wherever you'd like

Now we have a son too (that's him in the picture on top -- Eliza
was the photographer), and on the the fourth of July I take the whole family 
up to the roof to watch the fireworks, and from the roof we can look
in all different directions and see little fireworks going off all over, 
and I just look around me and think how beautiful it all is, and how 
funny it is that the world is so full of anger and suspicion and hate 
while here in Queens people from all over the world shop in the same 
stores and walk the same streets and live in friendship and peace.<P>

Sometimes I'll tease Lucille and Raymond by saying "Yeah, we're getting 
tired of living in Queens.  We're thinking it's time to move on."  
I'll watch their faces brighten, I'll wait a few beats, and then I'll 
say: "We're looking at some great places in Brooklyn."<P> 

One of these days we'll break it to them that we're 
raising the kids Buddhists.<P>
