<H2>Flushing</H2>

When I was born in Flushing it was a humble, bustling lower
middle-class community getting new life from two new 
developments: the World's Fair in Flushing Meadows Park, 
and Shea Stadium, also in the park, where the Mets
(and the Beatles) soon would play.  <P>

Since then Flushing has become New York's new Chinatown.
The 'main' Chinatown is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan,
but that one plays to the tourists.  Here it's seriously
Chinese.  And Korean.  And Afghani.  And Burmese.  And Thai.  <P>  

A few 17th Century Dutch houses still exist alongside
the noodle soup shops and cheap department 
stores of Main Street, one of the most crowded and 
chaotic streets in New York City.   
The drivers drive according to Beijing rules:
if you're passing through here on a Saturday 
afternoon, you might as well put your
car into park -- you're going to be 
hanging around a long time.<P>

I was recently hit by a car on Parsons Boulevard (a couple
of blocks east of Main Street), and in trying to settle the
accident (a minor fender-bender, which should have been
easy to settle) I was for a moment taken directly into the surreal, 
otherworldly heart of Flushing's Korean community.  The person who
hit me was a frightened 23-year-old, a waiter at a Korean restaurant
who'd been in this country for a year.  The accident was entirely
his fault, but I made the mistake of going to his home and allowing 
him to call his brother and sister (and several other people, it seemed --
they spoke in Korean as I sat waiting) before making him hand over his 
insurance information.  Half of Korean Flushing then descended upon 
me, it seemed.  I was phoned dozens of times at home and at work, 
each time by a different person who'd been "asked to help."  The
original 23-year-old and I were suddenly in the center of a swirling 
vortex of activity -- I would not have been surprised to learn that
news of the fender-bender was resonating through the streets of 
Pyongyang and Seoul, as well as those of New York.  <P>

The end of the story is not nice or heartwarming: I gave in to the
heartfelt pleas and entreaties and allowed my car to be taken to
a Korean auto-body shop (where it would be settled with cash, no
insurance).  I inspected the shop and approved it -- I later 
discovered that immediately after I left the shop my car had
been moved to another Korean auto-body shop, a much cheaper and
sloppier one that I never would have approved of.  Though it was 
necessary to replace all the damaged parts, these mechanics began trying 
to hammer out and repaint the parts instead, somehow imagining that I wouldn't
know the difference.  Fortunately, I caught them in the act (I'm 
not as stupid as I look), and removed my car from the premises
before they got too far.  I then went straight to the police, filled
out the required accident report and applied for insurance (as I 
should have in the first place).  I also went for a walk with the
23-year-old who'd originally hit me, who was now more frightened than ever, 
and said to him: "Despite what your brother and sister must have told you --
here in America people <I>sometimes</I> do things the honest way.  Try
it next time."<P>

I was a bit angry at first, but now that some time has passed I'm able
to view this with a little more humor.  I should have known, after the
fortieth Korean called me on the phone, that so many people would not
have gotten involved if there wasn't some scam going on.  And I still
remember the touching moment when the guy who hit me took me into his
home and kicked his shoes off.  I stood behind him -- was I supposed
to kick my sneakers off as well?  It seemed odd to enter a stranger's
house in my socks, but I did so, and nobody in the house looked at me 
funny for it.<P>

I sense a future Asian Mafia brewing here in Flushing, but I'll try not
to be judgmental.  We all come from similar roots.<P>

<H2>Bayside</H2>

What is there to say about Bayside?  Houses, lots of 
houses.  It's beyond the reach of the subway system, so
Bayside doesn't really feel like city to me.  One way to 
put it: Queens people who wish they lived in Manhattan 
and can't afford it live in Astoria or Jamaica or Forest Hills; 
Queens people who wish they lived on Long Island live in 
Bayside.  <P>

This is Utopia Parkway near Northern Boulevard, a few blocks
away from the largest Taco Bell in Queens.  This is a 
very familiar spot to me, and will continue to be until
they open a Taco Bell in Forest Hills.<P>

An interesting side-note, especially for those of you who've
wandered into Queensboro Ballads from 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/LitKicks.html">Literary Kicks</A>,
my Beat Literature Web Site: Utopia Parkway in Bayside is 
where a young, not-yet-famous
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>
got into a historic police-car chase and crash-up that led to his
arrest, which led him to begin frequenting mental hospitals, which
led to him meeting 
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/People/CarlSolomon.html">Carl Solomon</A>
and writing
'<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/Poems/Howl.html">Howl</A>.' <P>

Also, Perry Farrell of Jane's Addiction is from Bayside.<P>

<H2>Whitestone and College Point</H2>

The northermost extent of this part of Queens is Whitestone, where
the Whitestone and Throgs Neck bridges carry cars to and from the
Bronx.  Whitestone was actually named after a white stone:<P>

and that's about all I have to say about it.  College Point is
a fairly quiet, isolated corner, with a unique view of LaGuardia
Airport and Shea Stadium.  I have never found a college anywhere
near this community.<P>

<H2>Queens College</H2>

This South Flushing campus (which is nowhere near College Point) is 
part of the City University of New York.  Jerry Seinfeld is the only 
famous graduate I can think of right now.<P>

<H2>Creedmoor</H2>

There's a large mental hospital here, visible from the Grand Central
Parkway or the Expressway.  Lou Reed (of Brooklyn and Long Island)
seems to have spent some time here:<P>

<CENTER><I>
Creedmoor treated me really good and Payne-Whitney was even better<BR>
And when I flipped out on PHC I was so sad I didn't even get a letter<BR>
All of the drugs that we took, it really was lots of fun<BR>
But when they shoot you up with thorazine and crystal smoke you choke like a son of a gun<BR>
-- From "Kill Your Sons" <P>

<H2>Douglaston and Little Neck</H2>

These are slightly fancier, more suburban and reclusive old
communities to the east of Bayside.  John McEnroe (hot-tempered
tennis star) is from Douglaston.  I don't have much else
to say about this suburban corner of Queens.<P>
