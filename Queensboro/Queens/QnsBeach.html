<H3>Rockaway Beach</H3>
By the Ramones<P>

Chewing out a rhythm on my bubble gum<BR>
The sun is out and I want some<BR>
It's not hard not far to reach<BR>
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach<P>

Up on the rooftop, out on the street<BR>
Down in the playground, the hot concrete<BR>
Bus ride is too slow<BR>
They blast out the disco on the radio<P>

Rock Rock Rockaway Beach<BR>
Rock Rock Rockaway Beach<BR>
Rock Rock Rockaway Beach<BR>
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach<P>

I took the picture (above) in the winter, when the beach was mostly 
deserted.  If you want to see what it looks like in the summer, here's
the cool picture picture Punk Magazine artist John Holmstrom drew to 
illustrate the Ramones song on the original lyric sleeve for their great 
album 'Rocket To Russia':<P>
