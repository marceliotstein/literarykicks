Said I remember when we used to sit<BR>
in a government yard in Trenchtown<BR>
and then Georgie would make the fire light<BR>
and it was logwood burning through the night<BR>
then we would cook cornmeal porridge<BR>
of which I'll share with you<BR>
my feet is my only carriage<BR>
and so I've got to push on through<BR></I>

Back in the days before I was Cool J<BR>
I used to hang up on the corner pumping games people play<BR>
Sitting on a garbage can rhyming to my man<BR>
Talking 'bout big money and future plans<BR>
Always told the brothers if I got a contract<BR>
When the money started flowing I'd be back<BR>
To do a jam, against all odds ...<BR>
Introduce the rapper #1 from Farmer's Boulevard ...<BR></I>
-- LL Cool J, "Farmer's Boulevard"<P>

It's weird that two separate places named Jamaica 
were responsible for so much of the great music of our time. 
Jamaica Queens was not actually named after Bob Marley's Jamaica;
in fact there's some evidence that the Caribbean island was
named after the old Queens country village, which was one of the
earliest communities in Dutch/Colonial New York.  This village, 
like many places in or near early New York (Manhattan, Hackensack,
Gowanus) was named after an native-American tribe, in this case 
the <I>Jamecos</I>.<P>

As much as I love Reggae, I love Queens rap more.  Bands 
like A Tribe Called Quest, whose album <I>Midnight Marauders</I>
is one of the smoothest and coolest sets of sounds ever
committed to laser.  LL Cool J, whose incisive commentary on 
America could be as cutting as Eddie Murphy's or Richard Pryor's,
but who made it sound <I>good</I>.  Run-DMC, the guys who invented
the way rap sounds, back before any of these other guys existed.<P>

I can't even begin to name all the great rappers from Queens.  One
of the guys from Eric B. and Rakim (I can't remember which) is 
from here.  Salt 'N Pepa are too.  Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest 
sings, "I dedicate this to all the MC's outta Queens -- that goes for
Onyx, LL, Run-DMC, Akanyeli, Nasty Nas and the Extra P".   A Tribe
Called Quest often mentions Linden Boulevard in their songs, and LL Cool
J constantly reminds us that he's from Farmer's Boulevard.  I took this
picture of the intersection where the two streets meet, aptly
celebrated as "The Famous Corner" on the supermarket sign:<P>

Governor and Democratic presidential hopeful Mario Cuomo was born 
and grew up in Jamaica, where his father ran a grocery store.
Donald Trump is also from Jamaica, specifically the wealthy
neighborhood called Jamaica Estates -- though I'm not especially 
proud of this particular Queens connection.<P>

<H2>Hollis</H2>

LL Cool J and Run-DMC are actually from Hollis, a slightly 
less crowded  neighborhood on the northeastern edge of Jamaica 
proper.  The photographer Robert Mapplethorpe was also a native 
of Hollis, though his parents (like mine) moved to Long Island when 
he was very young.<P>

<H2>Rosedale-Laurelton</H2>

These are quiet residential communities on the southeastern 
edge of Queens.  I lived in Laurelton between the ages of 
one and four, and I have pleasant memories of our brick 
row-house and the neighbors and the plastic swimming pool 
we used to drag out to the front sidewalk. <P> 

<H2>Richmond Hill</H2>

Jack Kerouac's family moved to Richmond Hill after leaving Ozone Park.
They didn't like Richmond Hill any better.  Here's a 
picture I took on Liberty Avenue one Sunday morning: <P>
