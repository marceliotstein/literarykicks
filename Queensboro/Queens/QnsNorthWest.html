<H1>Queens -- North West Region</H1>
<H3>(Long Island City, Newtown Creek, Astoria, Steinway, Woodside and Sunnyside</H3>

<H2>Long Island City and Newtown Creek</H2>

This is where civilization breaks down and the factories take
over.  Long Island City is a surreal town, especially at night,
when the factories seem to glow with unworldly activity.  Just
what are they so busy <I>doing</I>?  The imagination can
run wild here, if you let it.<P>

Citicorp built a large skyscraper here, but it stands alone and
does not rehabilitate the area.  Hookers prowl the corners
in white furs, ghostly cabs roam.  I don't know if you can 
tell ... but I love Long Island City.<P> 

The industrial park's southern border is 
Newtown Creek, the body of water that separates Queens
from Brooklyn (though few people know this).  I took this 
photo from a bridge across the creek:<P>

Manhattan is across the East River.  Ancient iron bridges,
trundles, railroads and canals are at every intersection.  
Here's a view of the East River
behind some typically mysterious ancient black structure: <P>

The tall flat building across the river in Manhattan is
the United Nations, built so the diverse peoples of the world
would have a place to meet in peace.  What did they need it for?  
The 7 train only costs one token.<P>

<H2>Astoria</H2>

Astoria has a large Greek population.  The largest
park in town is called Socrates Park, and features a famous
sculture garden.  I could have taken a picture of that,
but I thought I'd show you a tranny shop with classical
aspirations instead:<P>

Astoria, on the northwestern edge of Queens, is known 
for it's film and television studios.  The Marx Brothers
filmed their first two movies, <I>Cocoanuts</I> and 
<I>Animal Crackers</I> in the Kaufman Studios, which have
now been turned into a Film/TV Museum.  More recently, numerous TV 
shows, such as "The Cosby Show," are or were filmed in Astoria.  I
believe "Sesame Street" is filmed here as well.  The
active studios are usually nondescript block-wide buildings,
easily mistakable for factories or warehouses.  <P>

The Silvercup Studios (which may actually be in Long Island 
City; I'm not sure) are probably more well known than 
the others for two reasons: the big SILVERCUP sign is prominently
visible from the Queensboro Bridge, and the roof where this 
sign stands was the backdrop for the very dramatic final fight
scene in the original film version of <I>The Highlander</I>.<P>

<H2>Steinway</H2>

I've never been sure whether Steinway was a town or just a section of
Astoria, but in any case there is a Steinway Street, and this part of
western Queens is notable for one major thing: Steinway pianos
are built here.<P>

Also, this is where my dentist is.<P>

<H2>Woodside</H2>

Woodside is pretty residential.  Not much to say about it.  
There are a few nude bars along Northern Boulevard here.  Pretty 
much basic Queens.<P>

<H2>Sunnyside</H2>

Also basic Queens.  Lots of stores and apartments.  <P>
