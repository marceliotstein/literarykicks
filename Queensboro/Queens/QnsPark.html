Many people don't know this, but Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is
the coolest park in New York City.<P>

Manhattan residents, of course, are snooty about their beloved
Central Park, and I can't deny that Central Park has its good
points.  Brooklyn has Prospect Park and the Bronx has Van Cortlandt,
and all of these parks have beautiful grasslands and lakes and trees.
But if you're interested in <I>people</I>, come to Flushing Meadows
on a summer afternoon.<P>

You'll see an explosion of immigrant life that'll bring tears to 
your eyes.  Two completely separate ethnic communities, the Asians
of Flushing and and the Hispanics of Corona, erupt into noisy activity
here every summer day, and there's more pure joy and happiness 
visible here -- laughing children, riotous ball games, strolling
lovers -- than you'll ever see in Prospect or Central Park.  The 
immigrants are largely first-generation here, and so you see ways 
of life that are not American.  The two games the young men play are 
cricket and soccer; I've never seen a game of football or softball here,
though I did recently see a group of uniformed young Korean women 
playing a very serious game of ultimate frisbee (don't ask me to 
explain -- I only observe).  Groups of karate students in white
robes practice leaps and twirl ninja weapons.  Pushcarts sell anything
you want, as long as you accept that it's nothing you ever heard of.
You will occasionally see an entire roasted pig on a tray atop a 
pushcart -- half-carved, but with that familiar punch-drunk smile 
on it's crispy face.<P>

I take my kids there on weekends, and we're often the only non-Asian/
non-Hispanic people in sight.  The park is nowhere near as well-kept 
as the more 'socially acceptable' parks in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and
maybe that's why most Queens residents don't come by.  But they should, 
and I think if they started coming they wouldn't stop.<P>

There are a couple of lakes on the south end of the park, and you can
rent a boat, or roller skate around them, or even try to catch some
fish.  In the center of the park is the coolest outdoor sculpture in 
New York City, 'The Globe.'  It has been featured in several hiphop
videos and on the covers of several albums including the Beastie 
Boys' <I>Licensed To Ill</I>, Craig Mack's <I>Project: Funk Da 
World</I>, and of course Levi Asher's gentle folk-rock outing,
<I>Queensboro Ballads</I>.  The Globe was built for the 1964-65 World's
Fair, along with several other strange and futuristic (now rotting)
structures that give the park it's unique otherworldly appearance --
an appearance that was used to advantage in the film of <I>The Wiz</I>, 
which turned these structures into an urban version of Oz.<P>

The '64-'65 World's Fair took place twenty-five years after the first 
World's Fair, which happened in 1939-40.  The park was largely built for 
the '39-'40 fair, though most of the buildings date from the '64-'65 event.<P>

The U.S. Open Tennis Tournament is played in the Louis Armstrong 
Stadium at the north end of the park every summer (it used to take
place in Forest Hills).
That stadium is south of Roosevelt Ave., and north of Roosevelt is Shea 
Stadium, home of my favorite baseball team, the 1986 World Champion
New York Mets.  Yeah they suck lately ... but I've still got my
videotapes of the sixth and seventh games of the '86 World Series 
to keep me happy, or to entertain visiting friends from Boston with.<P>
