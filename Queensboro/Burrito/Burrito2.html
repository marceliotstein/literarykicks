The History of the California Burrito (Part 2 of 3)
</H3></CENTER>

A few years after Hellhound broke up my life completely fell apart.  Actually 
I think it fell apart exactly at the point that Hellhound broke up.  I'm just 
a slow learner and it took me a while to figure that out.<P>

Kevin had been the dreamer of the group, and until he bowed out I didn't
realize how much I'd been caught up in the dream myself.  I wanted to 
be a rock star now; I wasn't even a great bassist, but I'd been setting my 
sights on this goal.  I was twenty-eight years old and working for a 
robotics firm on Long Island, where I'd been living for much too long.
What the fuck was I doing in a dull family suburb, working a 9 to 5 job?   
My life had no direction, and nothing in it meant anything to me.<P>

Not even Cindy.  She'd been my girlfriend since college, but our 
relationship had lost its magic.  When we went out to dinner I'd sit there 
bored, wishing to be home on my couch watching baseball.  Even when we
made love I was depressed.  She started to notice this, and one Friday 
night she told me she wanted to break up.  Which kind of took me by surprise.  
I knew our relationship had gone bad, but I also liked having a girlfriend
around to remind me to eat right and buy me presents on my birthday 
and call my mother so I wouldn't have to do it.  <P>

Now I was really confused.  I began hanging around my apartment not 
doing a fucking thing.  I'd sit on my couch with a bag of burritos and
a bong, and I'd watch pro wrestling and Knight Rider and any other shit
that was on, anything to divert me from my miserable life.  I lived 
in this marshmallow-like hellish condition for about three months,
not doing laundry or cutting my hair, sitting in a dull haze at work
and falling behind on my schedule, eating burritos not once a day
but two and finally three times a day, for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I'd
become a truly disgusting person, and I have to say thank you to
my sister Suzanne, because she was the one who got me out of it.
She called from California (where she now lived), and knew the 
moment she heard my voice that I was in a bad place.  She
offered to help me break my routine by coming to stay with her
for a week or two.<P>

I'd never been to California; in fact I'd never been much of 
anywhere.  It sounded like a fun idea, and I was happy to see Suzanne
again.  As soon as I arrived we stopped in an airport bar for a beer 
and a talk, and she ended up listening to all my problems and 
giving me a major pep-talk in which she explained that 
everybody felt confused when a relationship suddenly ended, 
and that everything I was going through was normal and healthy.  
Did I mention that my sister is a professional therapist?  I felt 
better after a few hours of this, and 
then we agreed to go out to dinner.   She asked me what kind of 
food I liked and I said "Mexican."<P>

"Really?" she said.  "I <I>love</I> Mexican food!"<P>

"You do?  When Dad brought us to Taco Bell I thought you hated it."<P>

"I thought <I>you</I> hated it."<P>

She got excited at the idea of having a Mexican meal, and
decided to buy all the ingredients and cook me up a big
dinner herself.  "Do you know how to cook?" I asked
suspiciously.  I was hungry, and I remembered Suzanne turning
up some ghastly dinners back when she used to take Home-Ec
in high school.  <P>

"Of course I do!" she said.  "Don't you remember the dinners 
I used to make?"<P>

"Yes, I do," I said sadly.  We stopped at a grocery store, and
my sister proceeded to buy the strangest collection of ingredients
I'd ever seen: a clove of garlic, a stalk of celery,
a tub of tofu, a package of bean sprouts, a can of black beans, a 
bag of lentils, three kinds of expensive European cheeses.  "Suzanne," I 
said. "There are four ingredients in a Mexican meal.  Meat, taco 
shells, sauce and cheddar cheese.  Period."<P>

"You don't know the California style," she said.<P>

We got to her apartment, and she went into the kitchen to cook.
An hour later she began the dinner by placing a dish of gigantic 
oven-warmed (and slightly burnt) tortillas on the table, then 
followed it with all the rest of the bizarre ingredients she'd bought
at the store.  "Okay, it's do-it-yourself," she said.<P>

I stared at the table.  "This is a nice salad," I said.  "Would
you please bring out the main course?"<P>

It turned out the salad was the main course, and that's the 
California style.  During the next few days I found myself
unable to get used to this.  Suzanne lived on Telegraph Avenue
in Berkeley and there were about ten burrito stands or tacquerias
on this street, but I couldn't get a real burrito at any one of them.
This made me feel alienated and homesick. The fact was, even though
Suzanne's long talks were making me feel better, I was still
in a very confused state. <P>

I knew Suzanne was right that I needed to snap out of my depression, but 
I still needed something to provide that climactic force and make
the change happen.  In search of this elusive thing, I took the BART into San 
Francisco by myself one day while Suzanne was at work, hoping to find
something in San Francisco to change my life.  
 I thought I'd enjoy exploring the city by myself, but 
as soon as I stepped out of the BART station at 
Market Street I started to feel a crushing, panicky 
loneliness.  I looked around at the shoe stores 
and donut shops of downtown San Francisco and felt lost 
and lonely.   Suzanne and her friends had given me a long 
list of places to go, but I felt overwhelmed by the 
unfamiliarity of everything around me.  Like I said, I'd never 
really been anywhere before.<P>

Suzanne and her friends had told me to go to the 
Exploratorium first.  I walked all the way over, but 
as soon as I stepped inside and paid my admission I 
realized I wasn't in the mood 
for a science museum after all.  I left and tried to 
walk back to the center of town but got lost in 
the Presidio for an hour and a half.   I reached some 
kind of deserted military settlement at the north 
end of the park and looked out over the Golden Gate 
Bridge.  The elemental beauty of the rust-colored bridge and 
black rocks and crashing waves only filled me with anxiety; I 
wanted to see the Brooklyn Bridge again.  I finally 
found my way out of the park by walking down some 
wooden stairs onto a nude beach that 
only got me more depressed because almost all the 
nude people were guys.  I pulled my
tourist map from my back pocket and began walking towards
the Haight.  It took much longer to get there than I'd thought
it would, and by the time I reached the famous
corner of Haight and Ashbury my feet ached and I wasn't 
in the mood to look at record stores 
or drink coffee or find the house where the Grateful 
Dead used to live.  Now, I realized,  I was in
the mood for a science museum.  I wandered and 
wandered and reached the Castro, where I 
watched guys kissing each other passionately on the 
street and wondered why they 
wouldn't rather be hanging out at the nude beach 
by the Presidio.  I walked and walked, lost and dying in the scary 
loneliness of walking; I found Lombard Street and descended the 
famous "crookedest street in the world" without enjoying it; I
reached Market Street again and looked up at the pointy Pyramid 
building and then walked on to Fisherman's Wharf.  I didn't know
enough at this point in my life to stop at the City Lights bookstore,
and I walked right through North Beach and ended up at Fisherman's 
Wharf, which disappointed me because it was obviously a place no
self-respecting fisherman would ever go.  It was nothing but
a shopping mall, with yogurt shops and crystal stands and postcard 
stores, all dim and deserted and closing for the night.   The 
sky was dark now, and I looked at the hushed skyline of cold empty San 
Francisco and thought of the line in T.S. Eliot's <I>The Waste Land</I> 
where he says "Unreal City," just like that, with no explanation.  
That was what San Francisco felt like to me at that moment.<P>
