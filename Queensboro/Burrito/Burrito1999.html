I used to be afraid of Mexican food. I didn't try a taco 
until I was 16, and that was only because my father used to 
pick me and my sister up for dinner every Saturday (our
parents were divorced) and finally he said he couldn't
stand going to Friendly's for grilled cheese and
hamburgers anymore, and wanted to try the new Taco Bell
that had just opened up in town, the first Taco Bell on 
Long Island.

My sister Suzanne and I were both food wimps, basically,
but we went begrudgingly, agreeing to try.  I ordered 
a taco and promptly announced that I didn't like it.  
Suzanne did the same.  We made Dad feel so bad he ended up 
taking us to Friendly's for dessert.<P>

I don't know exactly what happened after 
that.  I remember riding 
my bike past the new Taco Bell a few 
weeks later and getting a perverse 
urge to go in.  Something about the 
taste fascinated me.  I ordered a taco, 
ate it and left, never imagining that
I would do this again.  I repeated the 
act the next day, and then began to
do this regularly, soon eating two or 
three tacos at a time, all the time 
still believing that I was a person 
who did not like Mexican food.<P>

In fact, I was on the verge of a serious obsession.<P>

Once I became a Mexican food addict, the Taco 
Bell taco ceased to satisfy me.  The Taco 
Bell taco is a very proper, clean food item.  
The corn shell is crisp and neat
like a wafer, and it is filled with a 
symmetrical spoonful of spicy ground beef, 
some shredded lettuce, chunks of tomatoes and 
tiny, ephemeral confetti strips of melting yellow 
cheese.    It is a good food, a respectable food, 
but it is not enough.  I quickly found myself
moving on to the hard stuff, like the Jack In The 
Box Super Taco or the 7-11 Red Hot Beef 
and Bean Burrito.  The 7-11 burrito is the most 
concentrated form of Mexican junk food easily 
available on the East Coast, and if you see somebody 
eating this more than once a week you 
can be sure this person is in trouble.  When removed from it's 
plastic wrapper it is cold and clammy 
to the touch, and it is usually zapped in the powerful 7-11 
mega-microwave for three to four minutes, 
after which it emerges in it's true form.  Barely a food 
at all, it consists of just two components, 
a gummy white flour tortilla 
and a burning-hot glutenous paste of processed beef 
and chopped pinto beans cemented together by a 
peppery red grease that vaguely resembles STP motor oil. <P>

For three years I was a burrito-eater, 
and I lived with other burrito-eaters.  
I was in Hellhound, a heavy-metal/punk/thrash 
band that almost made it during 
the mid-eighties.  I played bass and helped 
write the songs.  If I had to describe us I'd 
say we were a combination of the Ramones 
and Jane's Addiction with a touch of Spinal Tap.  
We had one genius in the band, our lead singer 
Kevin Whitman.  He was a sensitive soul, 
and I guess we didn't realize how much our 
long negotiations with record companies and 
video producers were stressing him out.  
He really wanted us to make it big,
and one bad week after Atlantic Records 
decided not to offer us a contract and
MTV turned down our video, Kevin flipped out.  
He started doing jigsaw puzzles in his bedroom (in 
his parents' house where he still lived) and 
he stopped coming to rehearsals 
because he said he needed to keep doing 
jigsaw puzzles until he got his brain to calm 
down. For seven days he only left his house to 
drive to the mall and buy more jigsaw puzzles.  
Then he tried to kill himself in the middle of the night 
and got committed to a mental hospital.  <P>

Someday I'll tell you the whole story of Kevin Whitman.  
For now the reason I'm mentioning this is
that Hellhound used to play Friday nights at a dive in 
Massapequa called Diamond Lil's, and there 
was a 7-11 right down the block.  We always stopped
there on the way home after a gig.  Man! those 
red-hot beef-and-bean burritos sure tasted good at 
three in the morning when we were sweaty 
and beer-soaked, tired and hungry, deaf and happy.<P>
