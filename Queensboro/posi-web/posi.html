<H1>Elevators</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I work on the 5th floor, but a lot of the people
I work with are on the 40th floor.  Which means
I have to change elevator banks to get back and 
forth.  This gets to be a pain.<P>

The one thing I really can't stand is the 
ritual of holding doors while people come
rushing in.  There are six elevators per
bank.  If everybody would just mellow out
and wait for the next one, we'd all be
happier.<P>

Sometimes I'm alone in an elevator and I'll
see somebody rushing up to the door, thinking
I'll jump for the "Open Door" button in time
to get them in.  I stand peacefully in my
state of zen concentration, arms at my side,
while this happens.  Sometimes the person will 
emit a barking noise, like "WACK!" or "HUHMP!" 
as the doors close in their face.  Sometimes 
it'll be a harumphing, sweaty, busy-looking
businessman in a suit lugging a briefcase and a 
laptop.  This makes it extra fun.  Sometimes
the businessman will try to open the doors 
himself by smoothly wiping his arm
through the space between the doors, making no 
contact with any physical surface, believing (wrongly)
that the doors are controlled by a light sensitive
sensor (it's actually just pressure-sensitive 
bumpers).   I stand there calmly watching as
the doors shut on his surprised face.<P>

This hardly ever happens.  But when it does,
it's worth waiting for.<P>
