I was having another Star Trek dream.  This time with Dr. Soran a pretty lame Trek bad guy.  In my 
dream he had a nice smile.  I guess he was good.   He was guiding me across an Arctic planet.  My hands 
were so cold it was hard to grip the rope that tied us together in the blinding haze of snow.<P> 
 
<center>I've made and am every instant making<br> 
the movements of infinity</a>.<br> 
With infinite resignation<br> 
I've drained the cup of life's <a href="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/mind.html">profound 
sadness</a>.<br> 
I know the <a href="http://www.walrus.com/~gibralto/heart.html">bliss of the infinite</a>.<br> 
I sense the pain of renouncing everything...<P> 
 
I transcended sadness and the need<br> 
for comfort and joy.<br> 
I became so light<br> 
I was a subatomic particle.<br> 
I grasped everything by the virtue<br> 
of the <a href="index.html">inner light</a>.</center><P> 
 
I rolled over and clutched at his t-shirt (I could touch him and absorb his warmth without stunning his 
skin).   It was perfectly dark under the shadow of his body.  It didn't matter if you grasped the perfect 
emptiness in a cafe or a monastery or a mosh pit or a bar.  What mattered was staying empty so you could 
be a fucking perfect receptacle for light.</a><P> 
 
Everything is relative.  They decided that in Copenhagen.  Where they heard the sound <br> 
of one hand clapping.  Complete oneness and noneness all at once.<P> 
 
I had resigned everything infinitely.  And then had grasped everything infinitely.<P><BR>

is filled with light</h3></center><P> 
 
Of course I couldn't remember the dream the next morning.<P>
