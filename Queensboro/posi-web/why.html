Why THE POSI-WEB?


</FONT>


<BR>


<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>


Most of us in the POSI-WEB have designed many sites for the


World Wide Web. These sites have involved everything from


our personal home pages to major web projects for business


and non-profit organizations. We enjoy the latest tools for


production and presentation, spending many hours studying


the various aspects of these tools.


<BR>


<BR>


With the arrival of increasingly sophisticated tools


and browsers, the web is rapidly becoming "point and click TV"


in which the design of a site becomes reliant on a production


company with sophisticated and costly software. This is necessary 


for the entertainment value and impact a site needs in order to get the


audience they are looking for and offers employment to a rapidly-growing 


electronic publishing industry.


<BR>


<BR>


However, with "point and click TV"


the truly communicative quality of the Internet


is overwhelmed by the packaging.


This prevents the creation of a global 


community showcasing diverse lifestyles and 


highlighting the uniqueness of local 


experiences.


<BR>


<BR>


It is the goal of the POSI-WEB to present


the unique lives we live in a simple, no-frills 


manner.

Just what is THE POSI-WEB?


</FONT>


<BR>


<BR>


The <B>POSI-WEB</B> is a global collection of individually-maintained pages.


<BR>


The <B>POSI-WEB</B> can be entered at any member's URL. There is no one entry point.


<BR>


The <B>POSI-WEB</B> has no archive of past pages. 


<BR>


<BR>


Each <B>POSI-WEB</B> member has only three pages:


<BR>


One for an opening page.


<BR>


One for their expression. (Inner/personal and/or outer/living)


<BR>


One for the <B>POSI-WEB</B> explanation. (Like this page)

This explanation of POSI-WEB was borrowed from Malcolm Humes because
Meg and Levi are too lazy to write their own and Mal's is good enough
anyway.<P>
