I was born in Queens, but my family moved out to 
suburban Long Island when I was four and I never
got to feel like a city kid.  I moved back to Queens
as an adult, after I got married and accepted an 
offer to work as a computer programmer for 
a Wall Street bank.<P>

I took the job mainly because I wanted to see what it was like
to live and work in New York City.  I wanted to have a desk
inside a monumental glass skyscraper and buy lunch from 
a hot dog vendor in front of the Stock Exchange.  I didn't
think much about what it would be like to work for a huge 
multinational bank, except that it seemed a kind of unreal thing
for me to be doing.  The belly of the beast and all that. 
I'll try anything once. <P>

I quickly discovered that none of my co-workers found
working in the financial district
the least bit exciting.  This puzzled me at first.  We 
were located on one of the most famous streets
in the world, the entire city gleamed like Disneyland
outside the polished marble walls of our building, yet nobody 
seemed to care about this at all.  In fact, I soon began to notice
that everyone I worked with went to great lengths to 
avoid ever venturing forth into the city, and saved
their shopping errands for weekends, when they could
peruse the malls of the suburban neighborhoods where they
lived.  <P>

I found a stunning numbness here, an almost hostile
indifference to the beauty of the world outside our 
office building.  I remember walking back to work with my 
boss after a lunch that lasted too long.  We were late 
for a meeting, and we bumped into a huge crowd that ran 
all the way from the Stock Exchange to Trinity 
Church.  It turned out there was a ticker tape parade 
going on for the New York Rangers, who two days earlier 
had won the Stanley Cup for the first time in fifty years.  
Do you think my boss stopped to cheer?  No, he cursed at the 
crowd like Ebenezer Scrooge and fought his way to the other side 
of the street, leading me sheepishly behind.  <P>

It isn't just that everybody hates the city; the more time I
spend with these people the more I understand that they 
hate <I>everything</I>.  Or at least they seem to, because it is the
culture of Wall Street to never show joy.  Maybe some of my co-workers
lead wonderful lives at home; similarly, I bet some
of the Puritans of colonial New England had great sex behind
closed doors.  In public, though, we are <I>busy, busy, busy</I>.<P>

I don't play along with this. I'm a good programmer and I like
to make my projects succeed, but I don't let it ruin my mood when 
things go wrong or deadlines slip.  I also don't take work home with me, 
and I don't wear a beeper.  This may seem normal to you, but on Wall
Street this is what is known as a 'bad attitude.'  If my technical
skills were not in demand I would not be tolerated here at all. <P>

Once after a hysterical meeting in which it was announced that
a project had gone over budget and missed a deadline, I broke 
the mortified silence to say "Well anyway, it's a beautiful
day out, so who really gives a fuck?"  I do this sort
of thing on purpose, just to see what happens.  I can
now tell you from personal experience that this particular
sentiment is met with blank stares and total silence
when uttered on Wall Street.<P>

We are only supposed to think about our work.  
We sit timidly in cubicles and 
strain to finish our Microsoft Word
documents about PowerBuilder applications and
Novell Networks so we can send them 
to each other via Lotus Notes.  
We allow our software to tug us around by our nose rings 
like tamed bulls and cows in a mechanical farm, 
because our software seems to know mysterious things 
we do not know, because we are terrified of 
diverging from the proper path and getting into trouble. 
Those who are already in trouble walk the halls with 
hollow eyes holding styrofoam cups of coffee, clamoring to 
rescue themselves by figuring out the 
meaning of esoteric terms like object-oriented methodology 
or client-server architecture.  They 
babble insanely about these terms until everybody 
who listens to them is confused.  Eventually 
these people disappear like dandelions in the fall.<P>

Surrounding all this inanity, there is the city itself.  
I don't even know why I love New York City as much as I do.  I've
loved it since I was a kid, when I used to build scale models
of the Empire State Building with Lego blocks instead of 
playing with Matchbox cars.  I yearn to know every subway
stop, every bodega and playground.  I haven't been to Club Med
or St. Kitts yet, and when somebody asks me about this 
I think, why should I go?  There are still neighborhoods in the 
Bronx I haven't visited.  <P>

I know a lot of out-of-towners hate the city, and I'll often 
find myself talking to a visitor from Maine or Oregon or 
Nebraska who wishes to inform me just exactly how rotten the 
Big Apple is in his perception. I don't have any problem with this;  
in fact I think it is a healthy thing for a person to love his own 
hometown and hate every other place in the world.  I'll tell this 
person in turn what he can do with his redwood trees or soybean 
silos, and we'll have a grand old time and part the best of friends.<P>

What I <I>do</I> have a problem with is people who 
don't love their own hometowns.   People 
who sit at their desks and don't look out the windows.  
People who've worked on Wall Street for ten years and
never wandered inside Trinity Church -- who don't even
know that they're <I>allowed</I> to wander inside Trinity Church.<P>

Or people who live in New York City and never 
walk across a bridge.  Manhattan's bridges are not the familiar
kind of vast sterile structures that connect the interstate 
highways of America.  We have a couple of those, but
most of our bridges belong to the streets.  They're
right around the corner, next to the deli on Delancey Street, 
beyond a decayed marble entrance on Canal, tucked away behind 
City Hall.  And each bridge has its own unique personality.<P>

<IMG SRC="brdg_qb1.gif">
The Queensboro Bridge is gloriously noisy and mechanical.  You 
walk on metal graters that vibrate as the traffic zooms by.  There's 
something dangerous and exciting about this sensation.  Simon & 
Garfunkel sang a song about the Queensboro Bridge 
and called it the 59th Street Bridge 
Song.  <I>"Slow down, you move too fast ..."</I><P>

<IMG SRC="brdg_gw1.gif">
The George Washington Bridge is stately and elegant.  The pillars 
are square-edged and silver.  If you walk towards Fort Lee you see the 
bridge disappear silently into the trees of the New Jersey cliffs like 
a hand into a glove.<P>

<IMG SRC="brdg_wl1.gif">
The Williamsburg Bridge glides like a low-flying bat from 
Brooklyn near the Navy Yard to Delancey Street on the Lower 
East Side of Manhattan.  This bridge once belonged to the factory 
workers of Brooklyn's industrial waterfront and the Irish and 
Italian and Jewish and Chinese immigrants of old New York.  Like 
these ancestors, it is unglamorous and appears lonely.  Its
beauty is harsh and sad.<P>

<IMG SRC="brdg_mn1.gif">
The Manhattan Bridge is art-deco and minimalist.  It belongs to 
the Jazz Age.  I picture Jay Gatsby and Daisy driving on this 
bridge during one of their mindless jaunts into New York.<P>

<IMG SRC="brdg_bk2.gif">
The Brooklyn Bridge is closest to Wall Street, and it is the masterpiece 
of the bunch.  The towers are built of brown blocks of 
stone.  The walkway is laid with wooden planks instead of metal 
graters, and it goes down the center of the bridge, elevated 
above the cars.  On this bridge, for once, the walker feels more 
important than the driver.<P>

You've seen the design of the cables in cubist paintings and
Absolut Vodka ads.  You can walk right up to one of the towers 
and look up: the sky is cut into a thousand polygons above you.  
The polygons shift as you walk.  You look back at Manhattan and 
see that the city is reduced to a mere element in a greater tableau.  
The stark boxes of the World Trade Center, the marble edifices 
around City Hall, the gleaming modern skyscrapers of Wall Street 
and South Street ... they bloom silently.  The blue waters of the 
East River lap restlessly below.<P>

Stand here, and it is impossible to care about a project or a deadline.  
Water is the antithesis of anxiety; it is inexorable and has no cohesion, 
but it travels with the strength of karma.  To look at water, to grasp its 
rhythm and feel its flow, is to be calmed.  <P>

I stare at the East River during an annoying day at work, and I feel my 
life trickle back into my body like sap dripping backwards into a tree.<P>
This is how I stay sane on Wall Street.  These are the bridges of 
New York City.<P>
