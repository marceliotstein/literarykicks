<H1>Back To My Park (August '96)</H1>

Summer is over.  I spent a lot of time indoors this summer -- a lot
of time staring at computer screens.  But once I realized how fast
the months were slipping away, I managed to arrange one last trip to
my favorite park, Flushing Meadows, where ducks swim in lakes,
where the Mets get their butts kicked at Shea Stadium, where the 
most ethnically diverse borough of New York City gets together for 
a great big noisy family party every weekend day.<P>

I took my brother Gary along on this outing, and his two kids.  
Meg wanted to stay home with Elizabeth (our oldest) while Daniel 
and Abigail came with me.  Gary's wife took the day off too.  
Here are some pictures we took.<P>
