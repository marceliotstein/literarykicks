<H1>About <I>Queensboro Ballads</I></H1>

<P>I introduced <I>Queensboro Ballads</I> in July 1995, one year after
announcing my earlier project,
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/">Literary Kicks</A>.  
Server space was donated by 
<A HREF="http://www.levity.com/">Levity</A>, 
a venture run by my friend Dan Levy.</P>

<P>The following are detailed notes on the ten tracks that make up this
album.</P>

<H3>The Bridges of New York City</H3>  

<P>There are actually 17 bridges connecting the island of Manhattan
to New Jersey, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.  There are also 
several bridges in New York City that do not connect to 
Manhattan, such as the Throgs Neck and Whitestone Bridges between 
Queens and the Bronx and the Verrezano between Brooklyn and 
Staten Island.  I wish I could write about every bridge in 
New York City, but I only wrote about five particular 
suspension bridges in Manhattan that are accessible to
walkers.</P>

<P>I planned to use my own photos to illustrate the piece, 
but as I was laying out the page I used other photos 
as placeholders, including two shots of the Queensboro and 
George Washington bridges from an excellent Paul Goldberger 
book about Manhattan architecture.  After I developed my
own photos, I realized I liked these two better and decided to
leave them there.  The images of the Brooklyn, Manhattan and 
Williamsburg bridges are my own.  I hope
Paul Goldberger doesn't get mad.</P>

<P>The distant shot of the Williamsburg Bridge was taken from 
the roof of 206 East 7th Street in the East Village, a building 
famous in Beat history due to some photos  
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/People/AllenGinsberg.html">Allen Ginsberg</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/People/WilliamSBurroughs.html">William S. Burroughs</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.litkicks.com/People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A> 
took there, on the roof and on the fire escape, in 1953.</P>

<P>The image of downtown Manhattan at the top of the page is a 
screen grab from Microsoft Flight Simulator with the New York 
City scenery add-on.  The three bridges visible here are, from 
top to bottom, the Brooklyn, the Manhattan and the Williamsburg.</P>

<H3>Where He Lived</H3>

<P>Through the great concert setlist archive at Mark Leone's 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/gdead/deadicated.html">Grateful Dead</A> 
site, I was actually able to find the exact set list
for the Dead show Phil went to in '82, knowing only that they had played 'The Wheel'
out of Drums->Space.  This must have been a very good show:</P>

<P>Incidentally, much of <I>Queensboro Ballads</I> is fiction -- but I do 
remember Phil describing this show, and the great 'Wheel,' in detail.</P>

<H3>Floating</H3>

<P>The names are innocent to protect the changed.</P>

<H3>The History of the California Burrito</H3>

<P>Okay, I was exaggerating -- I never really saw a 
radish inside a burrito.  The rest 
is true.  This story was originally published in 
<A HREF="http://ezone.org/">Enterzone</A>.</P>

<P>The image of downtown San Francisco on Page 3 is a 
screen grab from Microsoft Flight Simulator with the 
San Francisco scenery add-on.  </P>

<H3>Apparition</H3>

<P>There is not actually a club called the Coffee 
Grinder.  This is just generally about the Bleecker 
Street/MacDougal Street "scene" -- Cafe Wha, the 
Bitter End, the Village Gate, Kettle of Fish ...
and it's about a particular time in life.</P>

<H3>Coming Back to Queens</H3>

<P>It was hard for me to call this part of the project
finished, because there is so much more to tell about
Queens.  What about the Bowne House in Flushing?  What
about Louis Armstrong and Ethel Merman and Michael 
Landon?  (Yeah, they're from Queens).  
Damn, I hardly even got to talk about Malcolm X (East
Elmhurst) or Helen Keller (Forest Hills).  Oh well -- 
I could have worked on these neighborhood sections 
forever, but then I would never have gotten to move
on to anything else!</P>

<P>I took all the photos, except for the shot 
of me and my son (4 years old at the time) 
walking back home from Shea Stadium, which was 
taken by my then 9-year-old daughter.</P>

<H3>Working Class Hero/Eleanor Rigby</H3>

<P>I had a really great time doing this one.  Someday, 
if I find the time, I'll digitize the entire video 
(about 25 minutes) and put it up here.  What a series
of faces I got, all in a single ride from Times Square
to Flushing!</P>

<P>This is my favorite piece on the album, I think.  I presented it, 
along with <I>Where He Lived</I>, as a "single" in early summer '95, 
while I was still working on the rest of the album.</P>

<H3>Snappers</H3>

<P>The painting is by Manet, and I grabbed it from the collection at the
<A HREF="http://www.cnam.fr/louvre/">Louvre</A> website.</P>

<H3>A Visit to the Walt Whitman Mall</H3>

<P>I grew up in Hauppauge, and we usually went to the Smith Haven Mall, 
which has better stores than the Walt Whitman Mall, and also 
doesn't try for any literary allusions.  Roosevelt Field is also 
pretty good.</P>
 
<P>We had a lot of fun taking these pictures!</P>

<H3>Loomings</H3>

<P>This is where I get self-consciously literary -- I felt I was reaching
a bit and almost didn't let this one out.  But a few people have told
me this is their favorite piece, so I guess it's not too bad.  Phew ...</P>
