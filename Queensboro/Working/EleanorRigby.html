Eleanor Rigby<BR>
Picks up the rice in a church where the wedding has been<BR>
Lives in a dream ...<P>

Waits at the window<BR>
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door<BR>
Who is it for?<P>

<P><IMG SRC="rigby-3.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120"><BR>
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?<BR>
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?<P>

Father McKenzie<BR>
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear<BR>
No one comes near ...<P>

Look at him working<BR>
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there<BR>
What does he care?<P>

All the lonely people, where do they all come from?<BR>
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?<P>

Died and was buried along with her name<BR>
Nobody came<P>

Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave<BR>
No one was saved<P>

All the lonely people, where do they all come from?<BR>
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?<P>
