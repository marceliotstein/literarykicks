As soon as you're born they make you feel small<BR>
By giving you no time instead of it all <BR>
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all<BR>
A working class hero is something to be ...<P>

They hurt you at home and they hurt you at school<BR>
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool<BR>
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules<BR>
A working class hero is something to be ...<P>

When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years<BR>
Then they expect you to pick a career<BR>
When you can't really function you're so full of fear<BR>
A working class hero is something to be ...<P>

Keep you doped with religion and sex and T.V.<BR>
And you think you're so clever and classless and free<BR>
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see<BR>
A working class hero is something to be ...<P>

There's room at the top they are telling you still<BR>
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill<BR>
If you want to be like the folks on the hill<BR>
A working class hero is something to be ...<P>

<P><IMG SRC="work-6.gif" WIDTH="303" HEIGHT="117"><BR>
A working class hero is something to be<BR>
A working class hero is something to be<BR>
If you want to be a hero well just follow me<BR>
If you want to be a hero well just follow me ...<P>
