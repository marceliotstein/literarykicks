One day I was riding the subway home from work and the words to
'Eleanor Rigby' sprang into my head.  '<I>All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?</I>'  I always found it interesting the 
way people let themselves be naked when they're riding home from
work.  In the morning everybody sits straight, bracing themselves
for the day ahead.  But in the evening they are tired of holding
themselves up all day; they collapse into their seats on the
train and you can see the stories of their lives on their faces.<P>

I decided I wanted to steal some of these faces, and to create a photo
essay with the lyrics to 'Eleanor Rigby' as the text.  I picked a 
day -- March 23 1995 -- and took my video camera to work with me (I 
could not use a standard camera, because the clicks would give me away).
I usually take the E train home from the World Trade Center, but I decided
to shoot my pictures on the 7 train from Times Square to Flushing, Queens 
instead.  The 7 train appealed to me for a few reasons: they run many 
trains on that line, so it's not as crowded as the E during rush 
hour; also the train goes above-ground once it reaches Queens 
(making it technically not a subway but an elevated line), and I 
figured this would give me good lighting. <P>

At first I was nervous pointing my video camera in people's faces, but
most of them didn't notice, as I had planned a subterfuge.  I held
the camera a few inches away from me and kept peering at the buttons 
and controls with a puzzled look on my face, hoping that people would
think I'd just bought the camera and was trying to figure out how to
use it.  Every once in a while I'd mumble to myself and touch a few 
buttons as if confused by them; in fact I was zooming in and out on 
particular faces and squinting to see into the viewer. <P>

I switched cars a few times, and also captured some good faces at 
the Queensboro Plaza station between trains.  My battery ran out
near Jackson Heights, but by that time I'd gotten enough good
shots.  I ate a quick dinner and rushed over to my friend Tony's
house (he has an Intel video board in his PC) and we spent the
evening extracting GIF's from the live video feed. <P>

It kinda bugged me that, with all the great Beatles songs out
there, I'd picked a McCartney song instead of a Lennon one.  I 
mentioned this to my wife, and she said "Why don't you do 
something with 'Working Class Hero' too?"  Duh.  Thanks, Maggie.
Here, on the next two pages, are the pictures I got.  I see tremendous
beauty in these faces, and I hope you see it too.
So here with no further ado is my 7-train 5-o'clock what-a-shitty-day
time-to-go-home
