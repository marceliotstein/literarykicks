     Phil Peverill had wavy brown hair and wore t-shirts and jeans.  
He'd played football and ran track in high school, but hadn't been 
especially good at either.  His record collection was 
standard-issue late-70's: two by the Stones, one Clapton, one
Foreigner, one Boston, one Styx.  We were assigned to be 
roommates for our freshman year at college, and the day we met I 
searched in vain to find anything interesting about him.  <P>

     He was from Johnson's Ford, a little town not far from our
school.  Most of the other guys in our dorm, myself included, 
were from the downstate suburbs, Long Island or Westchester 
or Staten Island or Queens, and so Phil became our token hick.
Ribbing Phil with farmer-boy jokes would become one of our major 
sources of amusement during the next few years.  It started only a few 
minutes after he and I met.  We unpacked, chose beds, and 
wandered out to the dorm lounge 
where a bunch of other freshman guys were watching TV.  One of 
them asked Phil what the red 'JF' on his black cloth jacket stood 
for.<P>

     Phil told them about Johnson's Ford.  "They named your town 
after somebody's car?" said a smirky-faced guy with blond ringlets 
like a helmet around his head. <P> 

      I disliked this guy instantly.  He had a wheezing cackle that reminded 
me of an old TV cartoon dog named Smedley. His name was Eddie Rothstein; 
in time I would come to like him, and in time he would become Phil's closest 
friend.<P>

      "Hey, what happens if Johnson trades it in for a Chevy?" 
another guy said.  This was Nick Moroney, who would eventually 
become my own closest friend.  "Do you gotta change the letter on 
your jacket?"<P>

      "Ah fuck alla ya," Phil said.  "Ford means bridge.  You'd know
that if any of you was educated."<P>

     That silenced them for a minute.  Then Eddie Rothstein said, 
"So what do y'all do, you gotta hand Old Man Johnson a dime and 
he lets you drive over his bridge, or what?"<P>

     I got into the act.  "No, I hear Old Man Johnson stands there 
with his pitchfork," I said.  "And if anybody tries to sneak over without 
paying he pokes 'em in the ass!"<P>

     "Yeah, but if you drive a Ford he only charges you a nickel!"<P>

     "No, only if it's Johnson's Ford!"<P>

     Phil stood smiling, taking it all in.  I think we came up with our 
entire repertoire of hick-town jokes during the first two weeks, and 
proceeded to entertain ourselves with them for the next four years. 
We constantly asked Phil questions about farming and livestock, 
even though he'd grown up in a suburban home with a father who 
ran an oil heating business.  There was a running joke that Phil
had an amazing natural ability to play any musical instrument.  
Whenever we entered a room where a guitar or harmonica was 
laying around it would be handed to him, even though he couldn't
play a note of music.<P>

     The fact was, Phil wasn't any different from the rest of us.  
Maybe it was precisely because the jokes were unfair and 
untrue that they seemed so funny to us.  Phil had grown up 
the same way we had.  He'd watched the same shows on TV.
He'd played baseball in the summer and football in the fall, he'd 
gone to school, he'd eaten burgers and pizza and wished he'd owned a car 
and spent weekend nights hanging around parking lots drinking beer. 
If Phil really had been a hick boy, it wouldn't have been funny to hand
him a glass and say "Yo Phil, I'm thirsty, mind running out to the
back and milkin' the cow?"  We probably wouldn't have ranked 
on him at all.<P>

     But he never protested.  Maybe he minded that we ganged up 
on him, but he took pleasure in waging a lopsided war against 
New York City and everything it represented.  We'd be watching
the ten o'clock news and hearing about the latest rapes and 
murders in Brooklyn and the Bronx and Phil would say "Yeah, 
gee, I sure wish I was from the city.  Shit, yeah, I'm missing out on 
a lot."  He started blaming everything on the city just to get a rise 
out of us.  Once he stormed back to the dorm furious about a 
calculus test he'd failed; he kicked the door open and yelled 
"Fucking New York City!" as if the city had anything to do with 
the fact that he didn't know calculus.<P>

     Phil had never been downstate, and during the summer 
vacation between our first and second year he took a bus down to 
stay with Eddie and his parents in New Rochelle.  This 
was a big day, and six or seven of us met at Eddie's house to usher 
Phil into the Big City.  Phil didn't realize it, but he'd called our 
bluff, because none of us knew Manhattan very well.  We got off 
the subway at 14th Street and 3rd Avenue and argued about 
whether or not you could take a subway to the Statue of Liberty, as 
Rich Mancuso of Floral Park believed, and whether or not 
Greenwich Village was a part of Manhattan Island and whether 
we'd have to pass through Harlem to get there.  I later learned that 
we'd more or less been in Greenwich Village all the time we 
stood there talking, and that Harlem was a fairly nice part of town 
where a white guy could walk without even attracting stares.  But 
we were frightened college kids then, and Phil Peverill took the 
train back to Johnson's Ford that summer believing that New York 
City consisted of a boarded-up May's department store, a couple 
of newsstands and a very crowded traffic intersection.  <P>

     For our second year we switched roommates: Phil went with 
Eddie Rothstein and Nick Moroney went with me.  Nick and I were a good match 
because we both liked our room neat and quiet and suitable for girlfriends, 
and Eddie and Phil were a good match because they liked their 
room messy, full of beer and suitable for Sunday afternoon 
football.  Nick and I developed a theory over a pitcher of beer one night
that all guys could be placed on a continuum between two extremes: guys that 
girls liked and guys that guys liked.  Nick and I were nearer the girls' guy 
extreme, the classic ideal of which was Rhett Butler from Gone With The Wind.  
Phil and Eddie were on the guys' guy end, the archetype of which 
was Joe Rockhead from The Flintstones.  When girls I dated
mentioned Phil's name, their voices took on the same tone as 
Wilma's and Betty's when they talked about Joe Rockhead.<P>

During our first two years in college neither Phil or Eddie
went on a single date.  <I>Playboy</I> centerfolds decorated
their walls, but women were alien invaders to them.  Females
did not speak the language they spoke.<P>

I often got sick of Phil and Eddie, and I sometimes got sick of Nick
too.  Just as Phil was the token hick in our gang,
I was the token hippie, and I got ranked on a lot for being
a vegetarian, for studying philosophy, for attending nuclear power protests
and listening to the Grateful Dead.   Sometimes I wondered why I hung 
around with these amiable lunkheads, but I guess there was something about 
Phil and Eddie and Nick that I liked.  Maybe I just enjoyed the random element 
of our friendship: a computer had assigned us together in a dorm, and 
thus it was ordained that we should learn to understand each other.
During the next few years I would even allow these beer-guzzling Young
Republicans to influence me a little too much.  I cut my hair shorter 
and started eating hamburgers and changed my major from philosophy to 
computer science so I'd be able to make some money when I graduated.<P>

But I also used to hang around with the college Deadhead crowd, the group
that Eddie Rothstein sneerily referred to as the Beansprout Contingent.   There
was Tonka, the eternal senior who must have been in his mid-twenties, who
could never graduate because he had to follow the Dead whenever they 
swung by the East Coast and would return to classes a month later with 
a relaxed smile on his face.  There was Matt Simpson, hacky-sack player 
extraordinaire,
who liked to be called Cosmic Charlie and who would eventually become a 
born-again Christian in Texas.  And there was Wendy, a little red-haired 
ragamuffin in torn bluejeans who somehow managed to get amazing grades
and was planning to become a dentist.  <P>

Wendy also happened to be an amazing pool player, and one night Phil
and Nick and Eddie and I found ourselves in the same bar as Wendy and
her Deadhead friends.  Nick and I started a pool game against Tonka and
Wendy, and when we lost Phil and Eddie took a turn, scoffing at us for losing
to a team that included a girl.  Wendy proceeded to clear the table.<P>

Phil took this as a personal insult, and challenged her to a round of
one-on-one.  She murdered him.  I looked at his face and saw an expression 
I'd never seen before.  Something had changed.  Phil had fallen in love.<P>

They continued to play against each other for the rest of the night, 
and Phil gazed at her with adoration as she proceeded to slam away shot
after shot.  At one point I sidled up to her and whispered, "What's 
your secret?"<P>

     She whispered back, "Three older brothers and a pool table in 
the basement."<P>

     During breaks in the game we walked over to Phil and urged him to 
ask her out.  He listened to our exhortations solemnly, 
nodding his head and staring at his beer.  Finally he asked us to leave 
the bar for a while.  He'd never tried to ask a girl out before, and 
didn't want us to watch him 'operate.' <P>

     He caught up with us a few bars later.  "How's it going, Phil?"<P>

     "Things are cool," he said.<P>

     "What happened?"<P>

     "I said to her, if I win this next game you have to take me to a 
movie this weekend, and if you win I'll take you to a movie."<P>

     "Yeah?  Then what?"<P>

     "I'm taking her to a movie this weekend."<P>

     To our utter shock, Phil and Wendy became a couple.  This honestly
surprised me; I was able to imagine them dating a couple of times, but
I never saw them as a permanent relationship.  By becoming her
regular boyfriend, Phil inserted himself right into the center of the territory 
I'd previously considered my own.  Suddenly he was 
right in the middle of the vortex of the acoustic-guitar strumming, 
bandanna-wearing, pot-smoking, 
Jeep-driving, hackysack-kicking, couscous-eating minority fringe, the 
fringe that had survived from the 70's and would eventually reemerge 
in the 90's.  <P>

It had surprised me a little when Phil hit it off with Wendy, but it
surprised me a <I>lot</I> when he hit it off with Wendy's friends.
He'd certainly never shown the slightest hippie inclinations before.
There was nothing obvious in Phil's personality that would seem 
to connect him to this group of people, and yet he was drawn to 
them and they to him.  <P>

Eddie and Nick and I felt slightly hurt; we'd thought he'd belonged 
to us completely.  Soon Phil was growing his hair out and saying that maybe 
Ronald Reagan wasn't really that great after all.  Wendy and her friends took
Phil with them for a weekend drive to a Grateful Dead concert in Glens 
Falls, and when he returned he wore a bright red bandanna around 
his sloppy dark brown hair and announced that he was a 
Deadhead.<P>

For some reason, this irritated me incredibly.  Maybe I was jealous
of Phil hanging with my friends, or maybe I was just in a bad mood
that day, but after enduring two years of Phil's taunts for my own
hippie tendencies I was completely unwilling to accept the notion
of him truly understanding the Grateful Dead.  I could only imagine that
he was trying to ingratiate himself with Wendy by calling himself
a Deadhead, and to do this was to cheapen something I cared deeply
about.  "Phil," I said, "You can't just <I>decide</I> to be a Deadhead.
It's not like a <I>club</I> you join."<P>

     "They were great," he said.  "Man, Jerry doing 'The Wheel' ... it 
was amazing."<P>

     "Where the fuck did you get that bandanna?" I demanded.<P>

     "I bought it."<P>

     "Bought it where?"<P>

     "In a store."<P>

     "See, there you go, Phil," I said.  "Real Deadheads don't go out 
to fucking <I>Macy's</I> and buy a bandanna."<P>

     "Then where do they get them?"<P>

     "They don't <I>get</I> them.  They just kind of have them laying around.  
Anyway, how many live tapes do you have?"<P>

     "My friend Ken taped Europe '72 for me."<P>

     I snorted.  "That's a <I>released</I> album!  Shit, Phil, you gotta have 
at least three shelves of tapes and they gotta be indexed and cross-referenced 
by location and date and whether or not they played St. Stephen or Dark Star.  
Come on, Phil!  You're a rookie!"<P>

I expected this phase to pass quickly, but it didn't.  Phil would
hang around our dorm room drinking beers and watching football, but then he'd 
tie his sneakers and get up and say "Well, I think I'll head out for a 
walk."  We'd know he was planning to end the night with his 
other friends.  Eddie would rip into him: "Oh, let's go visit
<I>Wendy</I>.  Let's put on Terrapin Station and chant for the sun to
rise!"  Phil would smile or give him the finger, depending on his 
mood, and then he'd be off. <P>

I only saw Phil once after college.  <P>
