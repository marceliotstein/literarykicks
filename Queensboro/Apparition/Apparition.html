     I'm sitting in the sleazy grimy Greyhound station waiting for 
the bus to New York, and I'm thinking: it was "My Fair Lady" 
that screwed up Todd's mind.  That was the turning point; before 
he played Henry Higgins he was a straight kid who never cut 
classes or smoked weed or mouthed off to teachers.  All the 
applause he got made him dizzy, and instead of going to music 
college like he planned to he decided to be a rock star.  He went to 
New York City, just threw himself into the middle of everything to 
see where he'd end up.  Which I thought was amazingly great.   I 
just never thought it would be Todd, of all my friends, to go and 
really do this.<P>

     Now he's in a band and they're supposed to play their first gig 
tomorrow night, and the bassist is sick and can't make it.  Which is 
why Todd called me, and which is why I'm heading for New York.  
I wish I had time to get myself in the right mental state, to get rid of 
the weird nervous feeling in my stomach.  I always thought Todd was 
half-nerd and that I was his guide when it came to anything cool, 
but now he's in the city playing in a band and I'm a college student 
writing papers on Plato and Aristotle, which makes me think 
maybe I lost it and Todd is cooler than I am.  A scary feeling.  I 
catch my reflection in a bagel stand's clear plastic shield: I've got 
neat moussed hair, no dirt under my fingernails ... I'm a fucking 
Connecticut wet dream.  I try to mess my hair up with my fingers 
but the gel I used this morning  refuses to give up control and now I 
just look like an idiot.  An old lady is looking at me.  I curl my lip and 
stare her down.  I decide I need cigarettes.  I don't smoke, but I'm desperate 
to change my image.  I buy a pack of Marlboros and light 
one up.  It tastes good.  I stub it out on the back of the seat in front 
of me, watching the antiseptic sea green molded plastic congeal 
into burnt black bubbles. <P>
 
<CENTER><IMG SRC="cigbus.gif"></CENTER><P>

     I step off the bus in New York City with the best bad-ass 
expression I can come up with on my face, and catch the subway to 
Atlantic and Flatbush in Brooklyn.  I  walk six blocks to the 
apartment where Todd is staying and he buzzes me upstairs.  I step 
up to his door and he swings it open and doesn't even say hello; 
instead he leaps at me and whirls me inside and drops me on a 
couch. "Thank fucking god you're here," he says.  He starts trying 
to force a large black Fender bass guitar under my armpits.  <P>

     "Todd!"  I yell.  "Calm down!  Say hello for fuck's sake!  Offer 
me a drink or something!"<P>

     "Oh," he says.  "Yeah, hello.  Shit, I'm hyper."<P>

     I kick my sneakers off.  "Aren't you gonna ask me how my trip 
was?" <P>

     "Yeah, yeah.  How was your trip?"<P>

     "It sucked."  Todd doesn't hear my answer, and I allow 
him to strap the black bass around me and plug it into the amp.  
He manages to do this despite the fact that his own guitar is 
hanging from his shoulders by a strap.  He checks his tuning 
and looks at me pleadingly.  "Todd," I say.  "You don't wanna play 
some music or anything, do you?"<P>

     "Shit, man," he says.  "I'm dying.  I'm so nervous.  This fucking 
thing with Spencer getting sick has me so damn mad.  You know, 
I was nervous enough already.  And the fucking dickhead isn't 
even sick.  He's got the fucking sniffles.  Man, I've been a lot 
sicker than he is without it slowing me down ... I can't believe he 
did this to us the day before our first gig."<P>

     "Okay," I say.   "But just calm down.  Look at you.  I can't learn 
songs with you hyper like this."<P>

     Todd takes a deep breath.  "Okay.  Okay.  Sorry."<P>

     "Anyway, maybe Spencer's just chickening out," I said.  
"Maybe he's afraid to go onstage."<P>

     Todd  gives me a long, significant look.  "Maybe," he says.  
"I've been thinking the same damn thing." <P> 

     Todd's had a lot of trouble finding good people to play with.  
For his first six months in New York he was bummed out playing 
lead guitar in a Pink Floyd copy band called Eclipse.  
He wrote me letters about the drummer who couldn't figure out the 
beat on "Money," who kept pacing the room babbling about 13/8 
and 26/15 time signatures as if his crummy drumming was a 
mathematical puzzle he could solve in his mind.  Finally Todd
dumped this crew and hooked up with a decent drummer named Ragusa.  
Together they found Spencer the bassist, and this completed 
their band. <P>

     I check the tuning on the bass and play the beginning notes of  
"Dazed and Confused."  I don't play rock bass at all; the only 
reason Todd thinks I'm a bassist is that I used to play classical 
bass, and I wasn't even good at that.  I played classical bass 
because I was told to in third grade.  One day Mrs. Pearsall stuck 
her hands under my armpits, lifted me up and placed me on a 
wooden platform in front of a six-foot-tall instrument.  She 
instructed me how to put my arms around the instrument and 
caress its wide womanly waist, even broader than my mother's or 
Mrs. Pearsall's, and she held her hand over mine to show me how 
to stroke a horsehair bow across the glittering thick steel strings.  I 
did everything Mrs. Pearsall told me to do and she made a big fuss 
over me and said I could play Carnegie Hall someday if I worked 
hard enough at it.  I held the first seat in the junior orchestra 
during seventh, eighth and ninth grades, and Todd was first violin.  
After ninth grade we joined the senior orchestra, but now instead 
of nice Mrs. Pearsall we had mean Mr. Minkof.  He was a skinny 
angry guy with greasy black hair falling over his forehead who had 
a Ph.D. from the Harvard Music Department and was furious that 
he hadn't become a famous performer.  He hated me because I was 
one of the crowd that smoked pot in the fields by the bike stands 
between classes.  I came into his class late one day with a pretzel 
in my hand and a goofy smile on my face.  Mr. Minkof went 
insane and descended on me like a "Fliedermaus" and smacked me 
on my cheek and sent me sprawling onto the floor on my ass.  It 
totally shocked me and I sat there with my cheek stinging and my 
arms and legs spread out on the floor, and I started to scream "You 
asshole!" but I was so stunned my words came out in a choked 
sob, and the story went around that day that I was crying.  Mr. 
Minkof got in trouble for hitting me, but I still hated him so much 
I never took a music class again.<P>

     Todd is still standing over me waiting to rehearse.  "Todd," I 
say.  "There's something I've always wanted to ask you.  You liked Mr. 
Minkof, didn't you?"<P>

     "What?" he says.  "Why are you talking about Mr. Minkof?  
We gotta get going here.  Can I start the tape?"<P>

     "This is a serious question," I say, intending to drag this out as 
much as possible.  I love watching Todd get frustrated.  "If I'm 
going to play music with you it's important that we demolish any 
barriers that stand between us and prevent us from truly rocking 
out.  This has been buggin' me since tenth grade.  Did you really 
like him or were you just kissing his ass all that time?  You liked 
him, didn't you?  Just admit it."<P>

     Todd flaps his arms in desperation, willing to give me any answer 
I want but not knowing what answer I want.  "I liked him," he 
says.<P>

     "You fucking slimeball bastard," I say.  "I knew it!  You traitor!  
How could you like him?  Why?"<P>

     "He believed in music," Todd says with finality.  "Now.  I'm 
starting the tape.  The bass is already in perfect tune.  I tuned it 
while I was waiting for you.  First song's in D."<P>

     "You don't have to tell me what key it's in," I say.  The 
tape starts.  The first song is a fast Primus kind of thing, cheaply recorded 
with a single mike.  Todd watches as I start plucking at notes until I find
the bassline.  It's a simple progression, D to E minor for the verse and a 
chorus of D, G and A.  <P>

     I feel better once I realize I know how to play, and after the first 
song Todd breathes a sigh of relief.  "So how the fuck is college 
going, anyway?" he asks me.<P>

     "About the same," I say.  "It's college."<P>

     "Why don't you blow it off and be our new bassist?  We need somebody
who isn't a dickhead like Spencer.  You're a dickhead too but we'll take 
you anyway."<P>

     "Todd," I say.  "I don't know how to play bass."<P>

     "Yes you do," he says.  He starts up the second song, which 
has an even easier bassline.  This one is called "Quiet 
Mystery," and I start to pay attention to the words Todd is singing 
on the tape. 

<I><BLOCKQUOTE>
A network of secrets that you spin like a web<BR>
I stand at your ocean but the tide does ever ebb<BR>
I want you here beside me but you're way too far to see<BR>
I gaze through a haze at your quiet mystery.
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>

     "Shit, Todd," I say.  "You wrote this stuff?"<P>

     "Yeah," he says, embarrassed.<P>

     I smile and shake my head.  "You think things like this?  Man, 
you're fucked up.  You better get some professional help."  <P>

     He shrugs.  "I don't even know what I'm writing, I don't know 
what it means.  I think I should see a shrink myself when I read 
some of the shit I write."  He plops down in front of me what looks 
like a white $2.49 nylon-covered photo album from Woolworth's.  
I open it and see page after page of handwritten lyrics under clear 
plastic photo sheets.   Some are illustrated with crayon sketches or 
magazine photo collages.  I see a section labeled "Fuck You 
Poems" illustrated with a bleeding black heart and a color 
yearbook photo of Todd in his nerd mode, clean V-neck sweater 
over a nylon shirt, hair neatly combed, in the middle of the heart.  
The first poem begins "Fuck you mom, fuck you dad," and Todd 
stutteringly tries to turn the page, pretending he wants me to see 
something he wrote on a different page, I guess because he realizes 
that I know his Mom and Dad, who are actually fairly cool people.<P>

     There's a knock on the door and it's Ragusa, the drummer.  
Ragusa has bleached blond hair cut so short that at first I think 
he's bald.  He sits and stares at me like he doesn't like me.  I think 
of a joke I once heard: what do you call a guy who likes to hang 
out with musicians?  A drummer.  Todd starts the tape for the third 
song, and while I work out the bass line Ragusa takes two plastic 
Chinese Restaurant chopsticks from his jacket pocket and starts to 
play a beat on the coffee table.  <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="chops.gif"></CENTER><P>

     We get through both sides of the tape and smoke a joint.  Todd 
turns off the tape player and we start to jam for a while.  Ragusa 
tip-taps away with his chopsticks on the coffee table and performs
cymbal crashes on the lamp.  When we hear the lock turn in the 
front door Todd jumps up.  "Shit!  I forgot to tell you, I don't live 
here.  I'm sponging off my brother, and the other two people who 
live here are kind of pissed off about it.  We gotta get out of their 
way."<P>

     "Who are the other two people?" I ask.<P>

     He listens to the heavy footsteps as somebody opens the door 
and steps inside.  "That sounds like Wayne," he says.  "He's just 
some guy, a lawyer or something, I don't really know much about 
him.  I don't think he likes me."  We gather our guitars and picks 
and patch cords and poetry books into our arms and get it all into 
Todd's brother's bedroom and slam the door behind us just as we 
hear footsteps enter the living room.<P>

     "Who's the other person who lives here?" I ask.  <P>

     "This girl Tara.  She does modern dance or something.  She 
doesn't really talk to me either.  I just try to stay out of their way."<P>

     "How did your brother meet them?"<P>

     "An ad in the Village Voice."<P>

     "Wow," I say.  "Just like 'The Real World,' except MTV isn't 
filming it."<P>

     Todd sneaks into the kitchen and returns with a two-foot-high 
plastic bag of potato chips and three bottles of Miller Beer.
We go over some more songs until Ragusa goes home.  At ten-
thirty Todd's brother Paul arrives from work.   Paul works as a 
computer programmer for a Wall Street bank, and he peels his suit 
off as he walks into the room.  He is tall and thin and more serious 
looking than Todd, with a trimmed beard and red weary eyes from 
staring at computer screens all day.  I see that he and Todd have a 
thing worked out that Todd doesn't speak to Paul until Paul has 
finished changing into a t-shirt and gym shorts and calling his 
girlfriend.  "Paul hates his job," Todd whispers to me as Paul 
mutters into the phone across the room.<P>

     "Why doesn't he quit?" I whisper back.<P>

     "He makes pretty good money."<P>

     Paul hangs up the phone and asks where I'm going to sleep.  
Todd shows him how he's rearranged the blankets on the floor to 
make room for both of us.  Paul shows me the Motorola beeper he'd 
taken off his belt when he came in.  "It might go off in the middle 
of the night if there's a systems problem at the bank," he tells me.  
"If that happens I'm gonna have to turn the light on and log in 
from here until I fix it."<P>

     "How often does that happen?" I ask.<P>

     "Couple of times a month.  Probably won't happen tonight."<P>

     Todd hands Paul a joint and Paul takes a long hit, exhaling and 
staring into space with his raccoon-ringed eyes.  "I'm beat," he 
says.  He gestures towards a gigantic record and CD collection 
spanning an entire wall and asks  if I want to pick out an album.  I 
stand up and study his collection.  He's got as many records as a
small record store.  About half are bootlegs, and I find stuff I 
never knew existed: U2 in Japan, Neil Young at the Bottom Line, 
the Beatles at Shea Stadium.  "I never knew there was a Beatles at 
Shea Stadium bootleg," I say. <P>

     "There's a bootleg of most anything you can think of," he says.  
"Especially if you're willing to spend your entire fucking salary on 
it like I do."<P>

     He pulls himself up from the bed to show me something in his 
Bob Dylan section.  "See this bootleg?" he says.  "This was 
recorded at the Coffee Grinder.  That's where you're playing 
tomorrow night."<P>

     "You're kidding," I say.  "You mean we're playing one of those 
historic old Village clubs?  Shit, now I'm even more scared."<P>

     "Ah, don't worry.  The place is a dump.  Once Dylan got 
famous he never played there again."<P>

     I look at the album cover, cheaply printed with a xerox of a 
skinny young Bob Dylan playing guitar in front of a brick wall.  
The club date is March 1961.  "Can we hear it?" I say.<P>

     "Sure."  We listen to the first three songs, but Paul and Todd 
are both tired and want to sleep.  I'm still wide awake, so Todd, his 
eyes closing, suggests I go into the living room and watch TV.<P>

     I step out of the bedroom and see a pretty brown-haired woman 
sitting in the dark watching "Love Connection" on TV and eating 
Ben and Jerry's Fudge Brownie Frozen Yogurt slowly with a 
spoon.<P>

     "Oh," I say.  "Hi."<P>

     She stares at me like she just turned on the kitchen light and I'm 
a cockroach running across her stove.  "Ohh," she finally drawls, 
understanding that I'm yet another person there to sponge off Paul.<P>

     "I'm Jonathan," I say.  "I'm sitting in with Todd's band 
tomorrow."<P>

     "Todd has a band?" she says blandly, and I realize that 
the bare minimum of communication has not taken place between 
the people currently living in this apartment.<P>

     "Yeah," I say.  "Is it all right if I sit out here?"<P>

     "Not really," she says.  "But I don't want to make you sit out in 
the hall so I guess I have no choice."<P>

     I sit on the chair farthest away from her and face the TV.  The 
wavy-haired California boy in the middle chair says "When the 
night began she was tame as a kitten but after two drinks she was 
wild as a tiger."  Chuck Woolery smirks and the audience goes 
crazy.  Tara licks the matte silver surface of the bottom of her 
spoon.  I think about the gig tomorrow night.  <P>
