July 2nd-9th, 1994<P>
 
July 2nd<P>
 
.... step out of the plane, 
<A HREF="../Places/Denver.html">Denver</A>
airport, a wall of heat and humidity. 
I thought we were supposed to be a mile high, shouldn't it be cooler here?
(No: fierce heat all week, Fahrenheit 90s.  Forest fires on the other
side of the Rockies: 14 firefighters killed.)  ....   walking round
Boulder, a very pleasant town.  Pedestrian mall lined with cafes,
galleries, bookstores.  Kids playing guitars on the sidewalk, long hair,
already a faint sense of 1960s timelag in the air ....   evening
performance at Chautauqua, great old wooden barn of a building.  Meredith
Monk starts her performance, & the thunder comes in on cue, first note, so
perfectly timed I thought it was on tape.  She sings sound poetry.  All
vocal but non-verbal, abstract sound which she nevertheless introduces as
if it had semantic content.  The musical form means that the timing is
absolutely precise, especially in duets with Arthur Een; but also, of
course, that there is no space for improvisation.  Uncanny; entrancing. 
Thunder rolls on, rain pounds on the wooden roof  ....  but is clear by
the time I walk home, half hour walk back to the hotel, pitch-black
streets, stumbling my way.  Am I crazy, doing this in America? .... <P>
 
July 3rd<P>
 
....  inauguration of the Allen Ginsberg Library at the Naropa Institute. 
Choir of 
<A HREF="../Topics/Buddhism.html">Buddhist</A> 
monks, in bright yellow head-dresses, chanting: head
monk with a bass voice so deep it out-thunders any thunder.  That's what
Naropa poetics are all about: the holiness of breath  ....  tribute
speeches pile up.  The Mayor of Boulder declares officially that this was
Allen Ginsberg Day.  
<A HREF="../People/GarySnyder.html">Gary Snyder</A> 
talks about libraries.  David Amram (old
beat musician, wrote the score for "Pull My Daisy") plays two Nepalese
flutes simultaneously, out of both sides of his mouth.  Antler instructs
us on the sex life of trees.  
<A HREF="../People/AnneWaldman.html">Anne Waldman</A>
reads, another declamatory, almost over-dramatic style.  But she looks great, 
looks scarcely older than she did 20 years ago, in Renaldo and Clara, maybe 
Buddhism is good for you....  Short poem by Bobby Louise Hawkins: <P>

	<I>He doesn't understand<BR>
	it's a joke.<BR>
	He has no sense of humour.<BR>
	If he did have a sense of humour<BR>
	he'd be surprised<BR>
	how often he needed it.</I><P>

.... Allen sits humbly through it all, suffering ambition, accepting
illusion, maya, dharma .... afterwards, I talk to him for a minute.  (This
is standard, all week, people are lining up to talk to him, get him to
sign a book, kiss him, whatever.  You stand in line with one  prepared
question, ask it, get out.)  He remembers me from New York last summer. 
He looks much healthier than he did then ....   evening performance: more
music from Amram, three  flutes this time.  Snyder, reading from "Rivers
and Mountains Without End," quiet, precise, wise; always a wonderful
stillness about him.  Ginsberg himself in fine head-rolling form, flinging
his whole body into the readings.  Breath is holy.  Sings with Steven
Taylor (who looks angelically young), sings "Father Death Blues," whole
audience weeps, whole creation cries ....  <P>
 
July 4th<P>
 
		<I>We carried you in our arms<BR>
		On Independence Day....</I><P>
 
.... first time I've ever been in America on the 4th of July.  Most of the
day is just hanging around.  Big picnic at Naropa.  Memorial tribute to
Harry Smith, mad musician, artist, writer, film-maker, collector.   Under
the trees, students reading poetry: loud, declamatory, angry.  Even
Vietnam is invoked; it seems more and more like 1967.  Hippy couples with
babies on their laps.  Only thing different: more tattoos  .... long talk
with Ginsberg biographer Michael Schumacher, who is now working on a
biography of Phil Ochs.  Don't trust Allen's dates, he tells me.  Allen
means well, but he gets dates wrong  ....  at one picnic table, an
archetypal view of the 
<A HREF="../Topics/BeatGen.html">Beat Generation</A>: 
Allen Ginsberg and 
<A HREF="../People/LawrenceFerlinghetti.html">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</A>, 
with between them 
Ed Sanders, 
leader of the Fugs.  They eat vegetarian hot dogs while people sneak up and 
take photos.  A strange grey-haired gnome is 
<A HREF="../People/GregoryCorso.html">Gregory Corso</A> 
.....   today's 30 seconds with Allen,
I get him to sign my copy of "First Blues."  He's talking to someone else
about Peter Orlovsky, now in a sad state in Harlem, cocaine and alcohol;
case workers' advice is that Allen should not see him for a while.  But
their vow remains .....  4th of July fireworks  ....  late night
performance at the Boulder Theatre, by 
<A HREF="../People/KenKesey.html">Ken Kesey</A> 
and his Merry Pranksters.  Sad disappointment.  Long, amateurish, boring, 
unfunny.  (Some students take great exception; later in the week 
they launch a furious attack on
Kesey, who in turn calls them stupid, storms off in his bus, says he's
never coming back to Boulder.)  All week, this is the only reputation that
crashes .... <P>
 
July 5th<P>
 
.... at last we're into the regular schedule.  Lecture at 1pm, panel at
3pm, reading at 8pm: pattern for the next 5 days .... lecture today by Ed
Sanders.  Sanders is one of the revelations of the week for me:
intelligent, witty, charming, and displaying an unexpected passion for
Ancient Greek Metrics!  Fine lecture, pointing especially to Ginsberg's
love of questions: what other poet uses the ? so often?  .... panel on
Buddhism, Snyder again the most intelligent, most to-the-point. 
Meditation, says Ginsberg, is a way of knowing one's own mind, which is
the instrument of poetry.  It cultivates a sense of detachment, and an
appreciation for the silence between words, and inside words  ....   I
meet with Gordon Ball, editor of Ginsberg's journals, and show him in my
xeroxes some passages of Allen's Rolling Thunder journals which I had been
unable to decipher.  One line especially, which I thought read "?????
calls Isis."  Gordon looks at it closely.  "I'm not sure," he says, "but I
think that word is 'Abraham.'"  I look at it and am convinced.  "Abraham
calls Isis"!  what a great line! already I foresee five pages of
exposition of the mythological implications .... later, I use my daily
30-second stand-in-line slot with Ginsberg to check out the reading with
him.  "What's this line say, Allen?"  He barely glances at it.  "Niagara
Falls."  Such are the perils of scholarship with live subjects .... 
evening reading:  Gregory Corso, totally charming, loving his own poems;
after one poem, "My favorite line in that poem is ... " and goes back and
reads it again.  Standing ovation; he gives an encore ....  Joanne Kyger
less impressive, the poems more interior, she didn't give enough to the
reading ....  
Amiri Baraka 
be-bopping and scatting through his
inflammatory rhetoric, an extraordinary "lecture" on poetry and short
stories, a deeply moving elegy to Miles Davis ....  <P>
 
July 6th<P>
 
.... morning in the tent at Naropa, Ferlinghetti is doing calligraphy
poems.  Large sheets of white paper on an easel: wash of ink with a broad
brush, then lettering with more precise brush, lots of lovely spill and
run on the ink.  The poems are for sale, in support of a student bursary
fund, $15 each!  My friend June buys one which reads "Old Sky New Clouds".
I'm waiting.  He starts one off "No ideas but ... " Aha, I think,
<A HREF="../People/WilliamCarlosWilliams.html">Williams</A> ... 
"... in beings."  I buy it .... lecture by Amiri Baraka. 
Revolutionary rhetoric like I haven't heard since the old days of Hardial
Bains and the CPC-ML.  "We are taught to believe that art has no force, no
effect.  So we become mere craftsmen, making cunning little artefacts for
devils who drink blood.  We are the good manners of vampires" ....  panel
also on politics, predictable discussions.  Testimonial utterances: Dave
Dellinger, veteran of many a 60s demonstration, now fasting for Leonard
Pelletier;  Dennis Brutus, on his way to celebration in South Africa;
Galway Kinnell, rather uneasily declaring that all poetic genres are now
political; nature poems are now about ecology; love poems are now about
gender issues.  And Kinnell calls Ginsberg up on stage to read "America,"
to remind us all how it's done.  Obligingly, Allen puts his queer shoulder
to the wheel   .... by way of reaction, I seek out for dinner Boulder's
most exclusive, expensive restaurant ....   some students complaining that
Dylan didn't come to this event, feeling that he should have, that he owed
it to Ginsberg.  I don't think so.  Dylan has always been very careful not
to intrude on Ginsberg's events; he stays in the background, he plays bass
guitar rather than lead, he appears uncredited on Allen's recordings.  As
the students' own questions showed, if he had come, he would have drawn
attention to himself, away from Allen.  Bob would never do that.  Besides,
he hates occasions like this, tributes, even (especially) when they're to
him.  Dennis Brutus told a story of Allen getting up in a crowded plane
(when everyone was supposed to be strapped in) and chanting "Don't smoke
Don't smoke Don't smoke!"  Dylan would never do anything remotely like
that.  Ginsberg is open, candid, willing to make himself vulnerable; Dylan
is closed, secretive, devious, absolutely reluctant to expose his
weaknesses.  Yet these are simply two different styles of leading a public
life, of dealing with the burden of people's expectations .... evening
reading:  Sharon Olds, so direct, so unassuming, that I am disarmed from
my usual criticism of her show-business morbidity .... Galway Kinnell more
"literary," but with a powerfully affective elegy for his sister ....
wonderful reading/performance by Ed Sanders.  I'm buying all his books and
records, even the ones sung in Ancient Greek ....<P>
 
July 7th<P>
 
.... long conversation/"interview" with David Amram: I get no chance to
ask questions, he's telling me what he wants to tell me.  I'm deep into
the trivia of dating the events of November 1971, the recording sessions
of Ginsberg and Dylan that month, no two people agree on when they
happened or in what order  .... talk also to Hal Willner, who's producing
the compilation of Ginsberg CDs due out in August  ....  lecture today is
Marjorie Perloff, who talks veryveryfast.  Most "academic" lecture of the
week, more to my element.  Curiously unconvincing background in
Wittgenstein; brilliant close readings of poems.  Ginsberg, she says,
always claims to be in the tradition of Pound, but really, he isn't the
least bit like him.  Well, I want to argue with that, but it gives me
pause for thought ....  panel begins with Anselm Hollo announcing the
death of Warren Tallman, and asking for a minute of silence (impressive,
when there are 500 people keeping silent) .... highly diverse panel, on
biography, bibliography, and other ancillary tasks ....  wonderful
anecdote from Bob Rosenthal, Ginsberg's secretary.  He's in a NY cab with
Allen, the driver is clearly Moslem, Allen asks what the driver thinks of
Salman Rushdie, driver says Rushdie has insulted Allah and deserves to
die, Allen (as the cab weaves crazily in and out of NY traffic) sits up in
the back seat and yells "I shit on your God!"  Please Allen, Rosenthal is
thinking, not while I'm in the cab .... 
Ann Charters 
reads two unpublished letters by 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Jack Kerouac</A>: 
not only unpublished, unsent:
addressed to a woman he'd scarcely met, but to whom he poured out his 20
year old soul as he embarked in the Merchant Marine  ....  evening
reading:  Ferlinghetti, benign, white-haired, reading "additional
sections" to "A Coney Island of the Mind" ....  Bobby Louise Hawkins, with
that marvellous acerbic voice, marvellous acerbic poems on the tight knots
of human relationships  ....  
<A HREF="../People/MichaelMcClure.html">Michael McClure</A>, 
grey-haired but svelte,
impeccably preserved, smooth, and altogether a bit too  smooth, one might
even say superficial.  But, for your sense of history, he too was there,
40 years ago, in the Heroic Age of Beatdom .... <P>
 
July 8th<P>
 
....  I ambush 
Robert Creeley 
outside the auditorium, talk to him about
Warren, and about the 1963 Vancouver poetry conference: both themes that
he takes up in his lecture, which is really more of a rambling chat. 
According to Creeley, he and Warren were 2 out of 5 members on the UBC
organising committee for the conference, and were continually outvoted by
the more conservative English Department profs.  But Warren told him:
Don't worry, all these people they've invited won't come; none of them is
interested in Vancouver; one of them is so established he's actually dead!
And when they all say no, the committee will panic, and we'll move in
with out list of invitees.  And thus came Olson, 
Duncan, 
Ginsberg et al,
to Vancouver in 1963 .... panel is deep in nostalgia, memories of San
Francisco in the 1950s.  McClure recalls Creeley arriving at a house in SF
and asking if they had anything to drink; all we have, they replied, is
the gin we keep the garlic cloves in; I'll take that, said Creeley, "and
we knew he was one of us." .... Sharon Olds puts on a mask, to stunning
effect .... "Poetry audiences," says Bobby Louise Hawkins, "are inured to
pain"  ....  reading in the evening leads off with Anne Waldman.  I still
think she overdoes the dramatic presentation, but there's some good stuff
here, especially a long piece on John Cage  ....  Creeley delights me by
going right back to the poem that includes the line "Poor.  Old.  Tired. 
Horse."  He is as precise, and as elliptical, as ever  ....  jazz pianist
Cecil Taylor gives an extended improvisation, which I think would have
gone on forever if they hadn't commissioned Ginsberg (who else could have
done it?) to go on stage and tell him to stop  ....   drink till the bar
closes at 1 with June and John, a 19 year old from Michigan, who is an
impossible combination of street-smarts and innocence....<P>
 
July 9th<P>
 
....   snap a photo of Gregory Corso, "I love getting my picture taken!" 
.... lecture by Robert Clemente, NY artist and Ginsberg collaborator.  He
speaks nervously, spontaneously, yet with extraordinary elegance. Fragments:
"The line of the drawing is the extension of the line of the body;
it is a borderline between two worlds. -- The Hindus believe that speech
is a tree, whose roots are lies.  Therefore you should never lie, because
to lie is to expose the roots of speech, and when the roots are exposed,
the tree dies. -- [on Hinduism as opposed to Buddhism:] The search for
knowledge is not a boring ascent to the ineffable, but an elegant sloppy
descent from what you already know. --  A good painter spends more time
preparing the ground than actually painting the painting.  Great paintings
have a light of their own, which comes from within, from behind.  The
ground is the pristine face of the moon.  -- A painting is not going to
follow you around the room: you can just walk away from it.  -- A painting
should give you an impression of ease, disguising the work that went into
it.  One should imagine the artist is in the studio taking a nap. -- In
India, I have no guru.  My teacher is my laundryman." ....  Panel on 
collaboration.  Steven Taylor says that he has learned, in
Ed Sanders' phrase, to "ride the bucking zebra" of Ginsberg's delivery
....  Philip Glass confesses that collaborations with people he didn't get
along with usually worked out just as well as collaborations with people
he liked ....  Corso is genially drunk, interrupting everyone with
inapposite remarks.  Then a woman from the audience asks: "Why are there
so few women on this panel?  Why are there so few women in this whole
week's programme?  Why were there so few women among the Beat writers?"
and Corso, suddenly utterly serious, leans forward and says: "There were
women, they were there, I knew them, their families put them in
institutions, they were given electric shock.  In the 50s if you were male
you could be a rebel, but if you were female your families had you locked
up.  There were cases, I knew them, someday someone will write about them"
....  then Gregory is back to the clown mode: "Why aren't we more
celebrated?  In Europe they name streets after poets, why not in America? 
Why shouldn't there be an Allen Ginsberg Street in San Francisco?"  "But
Gregory," says Allen, "there are streets named after you all over Italy: 
Corso... Corso... " ....   Reception back at Naropa, unveiling of
Clemente's portrait of Ginsberg.  I talk to Jerry Aronson, director of the
film "The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg," and get from him a signed
videotape copy.  He takes a photo of me and Allen standing together.  I
grin like a fool; Allen looks solemn, and holds his plastic punch glass as
if it were a sacred vessel. (I love this photo.) I ask him how he has
survived a week of such focused attention.  "In one ear and out the
other," he says, moving away  ....  talk with Yves Le Pellec, Ginsberg's
French translator.  I promise him, what else, a tape of the last Dylan
concert he was at (Toulouse, 1993) ....  evening reading, last gala
occasion.  Dave Dellinger reads from his prison memoirs.  Philip Glass
gives us 45 minutes of mesmerising solo piano.  Allen comes on for a last
hurrah, reading classics, "Sunflower Sutra," "The Change."  At the end of
the week Allen is as energetic as ever, his head still rolling back and
forth, his body jumping out of the chair he's sitting in.  Glass comes out
and plays piano as Allen reads from "Wichita Vortex Sutra" -- for me, his
greatest work, the climax of his vision.  So, also, the climax of the
week.  America redeemed, once again, in the auditorium of the Boulder High
School.  And everyone piles on stage to sing 
<A HREF="../People/WilliamBlake.html">Blake</A>, 
"all the hills echoed," visionary mantra, song without end ....  late night 
party, everyone there, Amram playing music, the police called, I'm suddenly
talking Scottish politics with a Boulder lawyer called Duncan Angus
Campbell III, Allen must be exhausted but he's still here, circulating
through the crowd, ready for anyone .... <P>
