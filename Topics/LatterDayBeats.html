<H1>The Latter-Day Beats</H1>

The Latter-Day Beats are the writers who carried the legacy of   
the original Beat writers of the 50's, particularly 
<A HREF="../People/JackKerouac.html">Kerouac</A> and
<A HREF="../People/AllenGinsberg.html">Ginsberg</A>,
into the 1960's and beyond.  There were countless Beat 
Pretenders and wide-eyed followers (like the callow proto-hippie poet
who annoys the Kerouac character so badly in 
'<A HREF="../Books/BigSurBook.html">Big Sur</A>'), but there
were also many who discovered voices of their
own, or took Beatness as a starting point and ended up in places
completely of their own invention.<P>

Many of the pages in Literary Kicks are about the "original" Beats --
the group of struggling writers who befriended each other around
<A HREF="../Places/Columbia.html">Columbia University</A>,
<A HREF="../Places/GreenwichVillage.html">Greenwich Village</A>,
<A HREF="../Places/SanFrancisco.html">San Francisco</A>
and 
<A HREF="../Places/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</A>
before they began to achieve worldwide fame between the years
1955 (the seminal
<A HREF="../Places/SixGallery.html">Six Gallery</A> 
reading) and 1957 (the publication of 
'<A HREF="../Books/OnTheRoad.html">On The Road</A>').
I've got my hands full just covering these writers, so I'd 
like to rely on external links as much as possible with the
writers on this page, which is and probably always will be a
work in progress.<P>

<I>Here's a

here are reviews by Dan Barth of a couple of Sanders' books,

<H3>Robert Creeley</H3>

The Black Mountain Poets deserve a good web study of their own, and
I hope somebody creates one.  Here, from the University where 
he now teaches, is a

More of a musician than a writer, but he's been showing up
