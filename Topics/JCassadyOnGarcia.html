<H1>Memories of Jerry</H1>

By John Cassady<BR>
August 10, 1995<P>

Dear Mercury News,<P>

My memories of Jerry Garcia are both as a fan and a friend.  He was a close associate of my 
father, Neal, for a few tulmultuous years in the mid-'60s.  I was a teen-age hippie/guitarist 
wanna-be, and I thought Jerry was God.  Although I saw him as often as possible in concert, 
I met him in person less frequently, but he was always kind to me.<P>

I last spoke to him only briefly after a Dead show in Eugene, Oregon, in 1992, which I 
happened to attend during a visit with friends in Portland.  It turned out to be, for me, a 
fantastic Prankster reunion. Kesey, Ken Babbs, George Walker, Zonker (Steven Lambrecht) and 
others of Dad's cohorts were there in the new "Further", most of whom I hadn't seen in 
twenty years. There was a private showing of Babbs' "Multi-media Cassady Tribute" that 
night at a downtown hotel ballroom, which Jerry and the band also attended. I was 
flattered that Jerry remembered me and seemed genuinely interested in my welfare 
after so long. That night he was cheerful and funny. When the management asked us to 
leave because the Dead's roadies had loaded in their own beer for the function (we were 
supposed to buy it from the hotel bar), Jerry stood up and announced, "We've been thrown 
out of better places than this!," and we retreated to Bobby's suite in their own hotel a 
few miles up the freeway to continue the party. Jerry skipped it and went to bed, and I was 
always disappointed that I wasn't able to talk to him more that night. Now he's gone and I 
never will.<P>

Years before I would timidly approach backstage doors to be intimidated by gruff security 
personnel until Jerry intervened and invited me in to talk backstage and watch the show. 
He'd be casual; I'd feel awestruck. He was just an extremely nice man. He was also my 
guitar hero, and directly influenced my own style with his staccato down-beat accents in his 
solos, the triplet hammer-offs, and the unique way he could play out of key and make it work.<P>

I think his legacy is the remarkable way in which he could bring joy to so many people from 
different walks of life in so many ways that made one feel he was talking personally just to 
you. I know he affected me that way.<P>
