<H3>I go calling on Carolyn Cassady</H3>


For a very short time I stepped through the looking glass and came to
live with a cast of characters out of my own chosen saga and rollicking
tour guide, "On The Road" and sequels. I beheld arrayed before me
Camille and Big Ed Dunkel and Henry Morley, the Moriarity children now
grown sweet and singular amid solitary outcroppings open to the winds,
spoke with Denver Roy Johnson and Inez the inscrutable offstage third
wife from New York (who related how she `financed "On The Road" and put
the phone down to go to the bathroom, and then after the effect of the
beer was gone she called Carolyn and wanted payment for the phone bill
because I was "interviewing" her, who had her own book or movie idea she
called "When the late, late train leaves for Alabam"  and informed of
various other addled details of a cracked mosaic), all of these present
in a magical mystery tour which began suddenly in the middle of 1972 and
ended suddener quite early the next year.<P>


A card was enclosed with a shipment from City Lights books:  `You might
write Carolyn - her address is 18231 Bancroft, Los Gatos...'   I did.<P>

A smalltown bookshop called <I>Modern Times</I> was well-stocked with City
Lights titles in 1972.  I was the sombre manager and sole clerk, which
meant I had much time to myself during the day.  As I say, I did write
to Carolyn Cassady.  Like most major changes in my life, it was an
impulse with tremendous repercussions.<P>

She replied, and what followed was a frantic pace of correspondence
throughout the summer.  The result was over four hundred pages counting
both sent and received, and at the end of four months I piled all my
possessions in my old VW and set out for California.  The sign at Bonham
State Bank told me it was just after 4:00 AM when I left.<P>

"You brought along all your possessions," said someone later, "and could
see out all your windows."  She had no way of knowing that.<P>

I drove for 48 hours with very few breaks and of extremely short
duration the 1,775 miles to the legendary Cassady homestead ranchito.
Perhaps you will remember Kerouac's first trip to that house in 1960,
just after Neal's release from prison,  as recorded in <I>Big Sur</I>;
his distress while moving south on Bayshore at the ticking swell of vast
neighborhoods all down the Peninsula until the whole of the Bay Area be
one bedroom community?<P>

When the Cassady's moved to Monte Sereno, a quiet and sparse
neighborhood in the trees above Los Gatos (itself a sedentary community
near, and not yet engulfed by, San Jose), neighbors were workingclass
and unassuming and also not much in evidence.  The house itself was a
middleclass vision of fifties America - a three-bedroom frame of one
story with the smallest pool I have ever seen out along a tiny patio.
The property was long and narrow, trailing off to weeds where Kerouac
slept during his visit and Neal stored his junked autos in later years.
All along the floor were those straw petate mats which sprung loose and
piled in a corner whenever the weird black hound Goofy was excited,
which was most of the time.<P>

(The house is gone, as of this date (October 1997) and a fresh new
foundation laid.  Barren spruce light the borders of 1/3 acre in a
rectangle which reaches back not as far as I thought when I was there
and the grasses grew brisk out back.  There is a portopotty, a
contractor's shed...<P>

Neal Cassady had washed up down along the tracks in San Miguel over four
years before I arrived, but everywhere there were links to him all
through the days.  Vast pages of letters under the bed, a portrait of
the sly old bum they never found, Neal, Sr, in the sunny dining room,
old friends come by for talk which sparked on him like static
electricity.<P>

Carolyn told me about Neal's spiritual conversion, resulting from an
epiphany at a parking lot where he worked - he discovered Edgar Cayce's
<I>There Was A River</I> on a seat of a customer's auto and he read it
during breaks.  He brought it home to Carolyn, and she was thenceforth
and forever I suppose committed to metaphysics.  I recall like timeless
ice floes drifting in the sun from the oceans of the Duluoz legend -
items like ancient portraits in my old attic undated, photos and scraps
of text; this is my memory of my time the last four months of 1972 but
please to remember this was singular history for me and so the snapshots
might be more vivid than those there before and after with no reason to
reflect on that particular unremarkable time - I hear Carolyn remembers
me fondly as "The Redneck" and son John doesn't recall me at all -
here's the transcribed voice of Neal, softly incessantly spinning his
cloudpatterns of phenomena and wonder, and that of Jack, punctuating
with  rimshots ("Words!"), a deconstructed view of Neal's bloated
monologue as an empty freight wagon over trailless wastes;  Kerouac
didn't cotton to no spiritual essence but his own, which put about in
storms..<P>

I would love to have heard that tape.  I don't even remember right now
where I read it.  I heard others.  They were recorded on an old
console-type reel-to-reel which was still working when I was there in
'72.    Most memorable was Neal reading his
`high-eternity-in-the-afternoon' Proust in a monotone in the background,
somber as a priest, with Kerouac close to the mike whenever Neal
pronounced `Gilberte' with a hard `G' to stage-whisper `Zjeeel-BER!',
proving he was Ti Jean, after all, fancy prepschool French-Canuck in the
room with the Holy Goof from Larimer Street.<P>

If Neal didn't hear the prompting then, certainly the contrast between
the two was not always absent from the equation.  Over and over in
Neal's letters, I read variations of `Please excuse this pitiful effort
scribbled out in the night during two-week holddown in Watsonville after
mild toots and blast in the john, three am and not a soul -'  He was as
self-conscious about his words before the educated bohemians as the
stately Elizabethan poets only pretended to be in their dedications to
patrons.<P>

He became attached to a certain astrologer and San Francisco character,
Gavin Arthur (grandson of president Chester A Arthur), who gave lectures
at San Quentin while Neal was a prisoner.  Gavin Arthur became Carolyn's
mentor as well.  In the same manner as Neal's patented passing of his
lovers, including Carolyn, down to Jack, he also handed his spiritual
discoveries to Carolyn.<P>

The pattern of the Cassady household by the time I arrived was
paranormal in the extreme.  Carolyn had quit her job, `walked on water',
some time before, without any firm notion about what would happen next.
She trusted, `It's a natural law,' that rewards flow back from proper
growth essence.  She held onto her credit card.<P>

Besides the aforementioned Goofy, the household comprised Jami, the
second daughter, a golden vivacious lovely lady, and John, the youngest,
an albino-complected musician who drew upon an aura of respect beyond
his years.  The kids were in their twenties, and they were the proof of
all the spiritual rhetoric I was to hear over the next four months.  I
have never known anyone with a more transcendental behavioral approach
to circumstance than those two.  I never knew them as hurt, angry,
bitter, or caustic.  They were presented with large doses of stress in
their lives;  raised by their mother with limited funds in a
neighborhood growing thick with plebes all around them, the absence then
death of their father, the variety of ills their station brought to
them, and yet they were always bright, cheery, hopeful, delighted.  They
were delightful.<P>

Let me see, since Neal had died, there were a series of houseguests. One
was a mystery writer Carolyn had invited to live with her, apparently to
allow her to write.  Carolyn insisted she not even bother to do dishes.
Later, Carolyn grew resentful the writer took her at her word. That was
a pattern I was to see again.<P>

The mystery writer died in a car crash in Mexico.<P>

There was a beautiful 16-year-old, perhaps a runaway, maybe just someone
who did not get along with her parents.  She did not leave a sense of
great warmth behind with Carolyn - I was to hear about her from time to
time, and little of it flattering.<P>

Then there was the bandit.  A revolutionary of sorts, he was a brief
tangent with the Gavin Arthur followers in the City, and Carolyn brought
him home.  He came armed;  Carolyn wrote to me about Goofy picking up
stray shells on the floor.<P>

He died in a dramatic shootout with police who had approached him while
he was hitching rides back east.  They found Carolyn's phone number
among his effects, and Carolyn furnished the investigators with
extensive background on the bandit.  I can recall Jami reading the long
piece in the paper sent to them, maybe from Chicago, I don't remember,
and with some mock exasperation stressing the `Mrs Cassady said..' after
it became redundant.  One strong characteristic of Carolyn Cassady was
verbal.<P>

<H3>At play in the world of publishing</H3>

That became a feature of her interplay with Ann Charters.  Just before I
arrived, Rolling Stone had run a piece on Neal and his death, and
Carolyn was prominent as a source.  I made trips to San Francisco with
her to visit the offices of Rolling Stone on Third Street in the City,
just a half block from Kerouac's fated legendary SP station at Third and
Townsend.<P>

We rode the train from San Jose.  Met and spoke with those who were with
Rolling Stone at the time, including Annie Leibowitz, the now-world
famous celebrity photographer.  She had come to Los Gatos before to
snapshoot for the Cassady issue; on one visit she walked with us to back
to the train station. I still remember how impressed I was she turned to
me and tried to think of something kind to say.  It wasn't easy; I was a
raw Texan without much connection to anything.<P>

But I did know my Kerouac lore.  Ann Charters seemed impressed.  In the
office of Straight Arrow Books, the publishing arm of the Stone, Carolyn
was interviewed informally by Ms Charters for her upcoming biography of
Kerouac. Particularly, of course, Carolyn could help with junctures
where she was directly involved;  Neal's drug bust, Jack's attempt to
move to the West coast from Long Island with his mother.  On the latter
score, I was aware of Jack's hopes that Neal could find his mother a job
in a shoe shop (Carolyn had boxes of letters under her bed, photocopied
from the University of Texas, and including years of correspondence from
all the Beat icons to one another and to her.) - and Ann Charters
remarked, `You <I>do</I> know your Kerouac!'<P>

[Actually, it was just a matter of a scrap of data under a bed springing
to mind;  Carolyn always thought I was more of an expert in the times
than I can truly claim.  This perception was aided once when John
Montgomery was curious about the phrase `bookmovie', and I was able to
show him the section in <I>Dr. Sax</I>.  By such incidental relations
are reps made...]<P>


She was less pleased about a question I had about the famous Ginsberg
bust.  I don't know where I had seen it, but Ann Charters produced a
version of the circumstances of the auto wreck, police raid on Huncke's
apartment, and Ginsburg's subsequent trip to Bellevue to avoid jail
which was closer to possibly a then-current sanitized newspaper account
than the accepted chronology in common use today.  Charters seemed a bit
defensive, said she had gone with the `best evidence'.<P>


Carolyn looked at me apprehensively while the interview was happening.
See, Carolyn cannot suppress the urge to express, although she had her
own book already accepted by Doubleday.  (In fact, some two hundred
pages were coming back from her editor, someone named Luther (better
known in publishing circles than to me) every week or two  -  yet
Carolyn never worked on her own book while I was there.)<P>

Ann Charters made an appointment to come down to Los Gatos on the
weekend.  She was practically licking her chops over the prospect.  `I
know just where this will go,' she said.  I think both Carolyn and I
wondered why she was consulted so late in the project.<P>

Ann Charters showed up with a friend, and without Annie Liebowitz, who
had been penciled in for the occasion.  Ann said she tried to call
Annie, only reached an answering machine.  I had my doubts about this at
the time.<P>

The friend was a nurse, but bridled under that identifier.  `It doesn't
define you,' said Ann, which was succinct enough for her friend, who
engaged Carolyn in a discussion in the dining room about astrology and
the rare arts while Ann Charters, a social smile pasted on her face, sat
on the sofa in the living room, copying furiously from Carolyn's
manuscript.<P>

The impression left by that Sunday began to sour with aging - not long
after, Carolyn and I hopped the train again, returned to Straight Arrow,
sat in that same office and split the galleys of the Charters biog
between us and combed it for items gleaned from Carolyn and her
manuscript.  The editor, whose name I cannot recall, was very gracious
and accommodating, only wondering briefly why Carolyn had engaged in so
thorough a set of interviews if she didn't want the results used.<P>

There was no explanation;  Carolyn was hyper-verbal, as I say, and
regretted it later.<P>


<H3>John Montgomery comes to call</H3>

He had been led to believe by Lawrence Ferlinghetti that Carolyn might
be available, so his trips to Los Gatos were a sort of courtship.  He is
somebody who stepped right out of his character in <I>Dharma Bums</I> -
the vague and surrealistic Henry Morley muttering inanities all down the
lonesome trail.  Just like in <I>Bums</I>, he would show up with gifts
pilfered from around the Goodwill drops in the night.<P>

Once he came with a Siamese.  Did you remember about Goofy?  John
didn't.  His arm was shredded, and he wailed `Would you grab that dog,
<I>PLEASE</I>?' while he went to retrieve his cat from the back of the
house. John left with the siamese, arm bleeding, and never mentioned it
again.<P>

John was making the rounds of friends with typewriters.  He had an idea
for a manuscript which was enhanced by Carolyn's connection with Rolling
Stone and Straight Arrow.  He wondered if she might interest them in his
work.  She offered no enthusiasm.<P>

In the days before multiple fonts and word processors, John intended
finding different type styles from the various typewriters he could
locate.  The idea was some sort of a dialogue, and I can only remember a
scrap he read to me.  One line referenced a literary lion, and the next
column explained those sort were not often invited to the same lunch as
those at the zoo.  It was sort of a cracked wordplay game, near as I
could figure.<P>

Of all the brokendown heroes I encountered that year, John was the most
critical of Kerouac.  He never could forgive his image as the doddering
klutz on Matterhorn in <I>Dharma Bums</I>.  I can remember tossing a
softball (`Jack was quite a woodsman, ey?') and John slapping it away
with a snarl, `No, he wasn't!'.<P>


<H3>The Hinkles</H3>

Big Al came by, and Carolyn invited him in, mostly because she knew I'd
like to meet him.  Carolyn regarded Al as - ah, considerably dull, I'm
afraid, and would not have welcomed a visit otherwise, I expect.  But I
was glad to hear him talk.<P>

I never met Helen, who was not well disposed towards the household while
I was there.  As some sort of a favor to Carolyn, the mortgage for the
Bancroft house had been taken over by the Hinkles.  This meant that when
Carolyn fluttered away from work, the bill came due, but to the Hinkles.
I still remember Carolyn very passively taking the call from Helen after
another month's mortgage was billed.  Carolyn was like a faith healer,
holding on past proofs of real earnest hardscrabble earthly deaths of
her gods...<P>


Al was a union rep with the railroad now.  His son was working as a scab
projectionist at one of the local Century multiscreens where the union
had thrown up pickets.  Al was laughing about how many times junior
crossed picket lines in the night serving a multitude of projectors in
the complex.  `Why shouldn't he be able to work where he wants?' asked
this railroad union official.<P>

You remember the beginning of Part II of <I>Road</I> where Cody, Ed
Dunkel, and Marylou show up in Testament, VA, in the '49 Hudson?  That
trip from the West Coast, Al told me, was more memorable than any of
them, yet it was left out of the <I>Road</I> because Kerouac wasn't with
them.<P>

Ice on the windshield, defroster out, Neal had to navigate through the
high pass with his frozen beak in the wind, jamming his head out the
window.  Luanne would take their frozen hands and place them in her
pants to warm them.<P>

`I might be distracted by that..'  I said.  I was merely trying to spark
some comment on the obvious - Luanne as a free spirit and the pictures I
have seen of her are beautiful - she looked just like a more sparkling
Debbie Reynolds, and this was in the '70s.<P>

Al looked back at me.<P>

`I was more responsible than that,' he said.<P>

Now, I've thought of that exchange over the years, and I invite you to
do the same.  You remember the events of this particular journey, I'm
sure.  Neal, in traditional manic depressive style, a working family man
with a railroader's nestegg in the bank and a second daughter just born,
passes a showroom spotlighting a new '49 Hudson, whereupon he rushes to
the bank, draws out all his savings, and buys the buggy.  He prepares
for his trip across the country, conning his wife (Carolyn) the while
with gibberish by way of explanation about the absolute need to retrieve
Kerouac from the east.  Next, Al is seeing Helen, who Neal figures is
good for the price of a trip across the country.  Somehow (the suspicion
is that Neal forged the alliance - Helen stoutly denies it), Al and
Helen are married, and the three of them set out.<P>

It became obvious Helen was slowing the junket (and blowing her
finances) by insisting they stop and sleep in motels, so (again, this is
debated - K in <I>Road</I> says the two cads just dumped her in Tucson
when her money ran out; Carolyn told me there was an agreement that
Helen would meet them later in New Orleans at the Burroughs farm -) they
separated, with Neal and Al detouring up to Denver and Neal's first
wife, Luanne.<P>

`I was more responsible than that,' he said.<P>

Al had come to deliver another message.  Both Luanne and Neal's last
major sweetie, Anne Murphy, resented Carolyn's statements in the Rolling
Stone article about how they somehow relished the frequent beatings at
the hands of Neal.<P>

Carolyn told me Neal had hit her only once, and he seemed immediately
overcome by guilt because she was holding John and the impact had
bounced her head into his.  Neal continued to provoke her, seemed to
offer his face out before her until she accepted the challenge and
slapped him.  She remembered catching him across the snout, his nose
bled, and he seemed perfectly satisfied he had somehow atoned.<P>

Unquestionably Neal hit his other women.  I was curious about a related
incident from <I>Visions of Cody</I>.<P>

Kerouac claimed to believe Neal's imprisonment on the pot rap was karma
for the time when he had thrown his eldest child, Cathie, across the
room.  Carolyn knew nothing about that, and neither did Cathie when I
asked her.  I am suspecting the `karma' equation might've been worked
out in the mind of Kerouac to assuage guilt for in effect abandoning
Neal to his fate during his trial and two years in the slammer.<P>

<H3>We go up to the City to visit Anne Murphy</H3>

She was a voluptuous little creature, with surgically-perfect breasts
and the legs of a dancer, which she was, around the strip joints of
North Beach.  Her voice was the sweetest you ever heard, and her history
was plagued by the ugliest harshest scrapes you could imagine.<P>

I was forever encountering roses amid the squalorous ruins...<P> 

She came down to street level to let us in, telling us not to look
because she wasn't dressed, while she ran back upstairs.  We both
looked.<P>

Her little apartment was clean and glossy in red light from contact
paper over the kitchen windows.  She sat down with Carolyn and very
expertly cut me right out of the conference.  She wanted to talk about
Neal in terms I would never understand.  She took an instant dislike to
me.  I wafted away into the front room to see what there was to read.<P>

Anne was one whose every thought was set by the stars.  Someone picked
her up and carried her to bed because he was an aquarian amid grim
picsean dusktime Sagittarius sortings.  Another fought with her because
Mars was ascendant in his telltale moons.  Nothing walked along on the
earth of its own accord.<P>

She brought me coffee, which I refused.  Anne apologized for
monopolizing, but said she and Carolyn would be talking...<P>

Philip Lamantia, the upstairs poet, comes down to visit.  I liked him.
You remember Philip?  One of the poets during the famous Gallery 6
reading which may be said to have launched the San Francisco fifties
Renaissance.  He was learned in tone and studied in delivery.<P>

Anne:  Do you think Ferlinghetti believes himself a poet?  <P> 
Philip: Of course he does;  his royalties announce it to him!<P>

I enthused about the rhythm and rapture of Ginsberg, or something, and
was pleased when Philip Lamantia picked up the effect in a reply as a
given.  Us poets, him from the San Francisco Renaissance and me from
Chico's back den in Bonham...<P>

There is Anne, dancing with that slow arm-swinging prance before her
full length mirror, probably her professional moves, sensual yet
esthetically pleasing, rhythm and svelte gliding like hawks in the
breeze.  Now she is sitting on the floor, brushing her hair, and she
smiles sweetly to me, the only time.  It's bedtime.  I thought then and
I do now she wanted to be in bed with us, and not for my sake.  I
considered it with great excitement but more restraint, because I was
not sure how the move would play with Carolyn.  Everything depended on
Carolyn, so we were at a standstill.<P>

Of course, I may've been fantasizing, as the boys will on such
occasions.<P>

In the night Anne drifted by in her luminous red teddy, like a spectral
vision in shadows, worried the noise of the waterbed might disturb the
neighbors. There was a loose slat banging against the floor.   Does this
never happen?  Guests usually are not so vigorous, she said.  I still
remember how precisely she spoke, did lovely Anne Murphy who cared for
me not a whit, a dopey Texan with no stars in his getalong...<P>

In the morning Carolyn jumped from bed to go to the bathroom.  Anne was
at the stove over eggs.  "You have a beautiful body," she said to
Carolyn.<P> 

<H3>Carolyn and I begin to fall out</H3>

She was dark golden blonde and wore her hair every day in a slightly
wavy ponytail.  She herself referred to an early shot of her and Neal on
the streets of San Francisco to the copy editor of Rolling Stone as the
Marilyn Monroe shot.  She was precisely to the day twenty years older
than me, and I was 29.  She was loving and kind then cutting and
caustic.  I believe the difference was in how I was then.<P>

I represented the gap between her presentation and her performance.  I
was there to point out how her criticisms might very well apply to her.
She was free of earthly passionate anger and resentment?  Then why did
she kick her dog?  We began to broil over points of doctrine and then
every aspect of behavior.  She was a mystical christian as long as there
were miracles to be had; I was nothing but an escaped baptist.<P>

A cult was left by the death of Gavin Arthur.  There were several
seances and memorial services for him.  I attended one where we cruised
on a barge around San Francisco Bay while Alan Watts read from Arthur's
own funeral service and they gathered handfuls of the clammy gray mass
of his ashes to toss at the very sea.<P>

Watts was puffy, redfaced, and bleary, spoke with a limping lisp,
carried a jug of dirty red (screwtop burgundy) aboard the barge.  There
were power struggles and backstabbings among the disciples in the little
boat - accusations and whispered plots and strident hauling of ancient
boxes of old astrology charts from dusty closets.<P>

I believe the strongest sense of pride for Carolyn at that time was her
involvement with the legacy of Gavin Arthur.  That was when she was the
most exalted, and the most resentful when she turned to me.<P>

The first break was the derisive comment, `Paul Newman is Paul Newman.'
We were coming back from babysitting for cousins, discussing the film we
expected would be based eventually on Neal's <I>First Third</I> or her
own works.  I was just running over resemblances to Neal in the stars -
we had been over this ground before.  This time, she snapped at me, and
that began a whole different interaction.  It was time for me to go, but
I had nowhere really to go.  And so we spent too long arguing late into
the night, her criticizing and me defending and noting her own standing
in her own lights.<P>

After a particularly gratifying visit with an esteemed member of the
Gavin Arthur foundation, she turned on me.  I was sleeping on the couch
by that time, and she began slowly and quietly and kept on and kept on,
lining out my own foibles as seen from the particular vantage of her
virtues.<P>

She threw me out at 2:00 AM on the 2nd of January 1973 in a reprise of a
scene from <I>Road</I>.  When I rose to pack, I never spoke to her
again. She made various comments, attempting to normalize, moderate,
pretend she was only doing what was rational and necessary.  I gathered
my gear and left without a word.<P>

I saw her on two occasions over the years since.  Spoke to her neither
time.<P>

I hear she scored $70,000 for the ghastly film made from her stitching
of letters into something called <I>Heart Beat</I>, and there has been
another book printed <I>(Off The Road)</I>, so maybe her natural laws of
economic forces worked for her after all.  I wish her well.<P>
